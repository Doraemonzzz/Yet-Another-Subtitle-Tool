0
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:18,030
all right the time still 30-some I make an attempt to to put something on

1
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:26,430
the website half an hour ago so the lecture from last Tuesday and today's lecture

2
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:34,219
must be there okay the rest is available starters I'm going to be collecting what

3
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:41,370
I had coming okay and I think probably two more on will email those register

4
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:49,050
some topics from books to read let's see another announcement we're going to post an

5
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:50,969
early homework but it's nobody need you for another three weeks or so but I

6
00:01:50,969 --> 00:01:53,639
want you to just know what

7
00:01:53,639 --> 00:01:59,910
is coming and just not reading and in the process of the homework we're going

8
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:07,830
to have recitation tomorrow so should we can introduce you to yesterday we did move

9
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:12,479
what you have done introducing led me to some programming aspects cocoa from vista graphical

10
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:19,860
focus because I think the Wake is preparing the homeworks he wants you to start

11
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:26,400
building little libraries that eventually lead to large-scale problems now if you don't want us

12
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:31,470
to develop this libraries in homework 1 we're gonna pass the solutions so you can

13
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:36,690
use from the second part hours but lastly whatever we post does it means the

14
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:42,750
right thing I mean we are also students and we post whatever so hopefully you

15
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:49,490
can do better than than us and hopefully there are solutions we post are your

16
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:59,759
solutions that's why I want you to factor right up and paste okay and what

17
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:01,470
was the other announcement and so in this process of we will have a recitation

18
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:04,170
this Friday but as I told me

19
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:09,730
very station the same ways the lectures are not thorry so if you don't like

20
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:13,060
to see me you don't have to come you know there are video lectures everything

21
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:19,800
is online you can watch me from your kitchen basically we're getting a cup of

22
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:25,330
coffee but there's gondola station at the same time of driving and again net1 Authority

23
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,390
because hold information will be posted

24
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:35,590
and so the homework the Lexus okay so you will notice when you reveal the

25
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:37,930
slides from let's do one there are some

26
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:43,570
topics that are not covered okay now those topics are really some little bit more

27
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:45,760
examples from the concepts that was

28
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,480
trying to communicate some of them are going to come in this lecture so I

29
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:57,400
don't have to do them some lady 3d will cover on Friday some we have

30
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:04,810
to read them on your own okay and but if there is anything essential I

31
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:07,270
will go back to it okay if I don't cover it means we don't really

32
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:09,820
need it for the shell code so for

33
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:17,380
example there is a big case study of publicity graphical model related to the biology

34
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:20,140
and as you guys know there is

35
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:24,700
nobody from biology actually I was asked yesterday polygamy I said we have any students

36
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,530
in biology doing this type of

37
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:35,020
things like not sorry you know so I don't know if I stopped working for

38
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:41,110
20 minutes in biology and I did clicker on the slide maybe a third of

39
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:49,380
humans reached biology and that is not gonna be  good right  pointing all the way around okay

40
00:04:49,380 --> 00:05:01,410
we're going to start discussing a limit about conditional independence relations and graphs but the

41
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:10,230
context of theoretical aspects of this conditional independence relations not the graphs represent this is

42
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:12,809
sort of an impure much so we will probably go back to it again and

43
00:05:12,809 --> 00:05:16,140
again for the next 23 weeks so we

44
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:22,710
have a very reduced understanding so - you can take the concepts today the lecture

45
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:25,320
scrolling up you'd be easy but

46
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:42,290
you know you don't have from the stir everything ok this is if you have

47
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:47,040
variables are showing absolutely zero independence relations this is an appreciation of the visionary all

48
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:55,170
right so look at it carefully all right not x1 x2 given x1 x2 be

49
00:05:55,170 --> 00:06:02,430
given x2 x1 several different positions like that because for example I can start with

50
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:04,770
x2 and the next one you will

51
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:14,610
experience x3 given you know x1 and x3 etc etc so in essence you have

52
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:19,620
very shove those and in some ways are not symmetric right the way that I

53
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:29,490
write them so same sort of symmetry sphere ok this expansion is very expensive to

54
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:39,930
do so just nibble on this if we have you say K values for its

55
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:41,670
variable X and you have both no so this will require a table of the

56
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:44,719
order of KT power V and

57
00:06:44,719 --> 00:06:52,830
this is the reason really we started probabilistic graphical models because we be asking a

58
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:59,850
question structures can you actually simplify this conditional distributions accountable for some independence relations other

59
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:05,310
ways you know looking at this is well explore given x1 depends on x2 and

60
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:15,930
x3 telling the trend of x2 and x3 the answer is yes we would factorization

61
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:21,790
that is very efficient so the discount that I did here it does not account

62
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:28,980
for normalization of each of these probabilities which is really it doesn't remove much of

63
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:34,120
the cost and so when you want a perfect one you can okay numbers to

64
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:40,930
describe it k square to describe excellent even x1 take you to describe this and

65
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:49,980
take the power bill escape to describe now we'll study machine learning right if you

66
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:55,090
have missed admission like that and if you want to visit in the context in

67
00:07:55,090 --> 00:08:00,070
the self classification problems there's a lot of text you can do but you don't

68
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:07,300
have to deal with complexity of K to the me and so here's one example

69
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:15,420
I'm going to making tables for each of this conditional probability distributions but inverse you

70
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:19,170
replace them with logistic regression ordinates looks like  that

71
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:26,050
alright so delicious that you see here it's so tight and we're from the field

72
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:28,330
itself in here it depends on all the

73
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:36,310
previous axis so I try to fit this distribution of science enjoyed a function with

74
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:40,150
a rival of somewhat it's doubly times the vector X for a for the previous

75
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:43,450
ones and then we may have not

76
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:49,540
seen this but yeah vs. are different there's no no services sigmoid function and the

77
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:52,210
focus of a label to take the K

78
00:08:52,210 --> 00:09:02,420
component of the argument and there is a nice model for this provision from a

79
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:06,890
movie of them and you won't have to fix a thing with to describe them

80
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:12,320
okay now it's not but the question is normally and I have the calculation here

81
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:18,350
so if anybody has any places from the power I get it it's actually still

82
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:22,280
taller than they want you to do the odds of those different against yourself so

83
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:30,770
it comes out of the the the post of this is K times miss Claire

84
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:34,820
before the possible straight to the power of me you know it's okay to whisper

85
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:39,620
so it's really I mean depends offensively is but they they significantly reduce from above

86
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:44,150
course okay however this method is not

87
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:49,100
very useful because each of this conditional distributions depends on the values of all the

88
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:54,530
other previous variables so you want to be able to do maths very sort of

89
00:09:54,530 --> 00:10:00,530
business in the college software plus fire so if you want people mixtures and you

90
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:05,690
want five modules you know account for evidence and things like that you won't be

91
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:13,070
able to do the algebra using this module okay but again there is more than

92
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:21,680
this one we have the tables nice fried this had some function alright and in

93
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:25,850
this case a few this matrix not many once you have it then this could

94
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:31,070
be an easy problem figure in the context of classification so what I want to

95
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:43,150
do this in this course we won't do something better some basic  things probability integral syndrome

96
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:50,690
conditional independence so I have 1 divided by XY and Z can be scalar K

97
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:54,590
vector so I say that x and y are

98
00:10:54,590 --> 00:11:01,220
conditionally independent given Z 1 FX 2 the y and z is equal to B

99
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:07,390
FX given C ok so tom is a normal something of Drive make a difference

100
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:11,170
when it comes to the value of x okay so this is one way to

101
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:15,100
I'd the traditional dependent of X for y

102
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:25,120
double Z this important that's why you say conditional because there is an argument either

103
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:29,430
now cosmas if you think this is a definition let me say the simple algebra

104
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:32,710
right I can write this more effectively y and z and then P of Y

105
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:35,800
given Z so those are this I can write

106
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:42,370
this as P of X given Z P of Y given C so we can

107
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:48,430
advances in the Commission to life as an alternative way that when this conditional distribution

108
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:55,630
for price is like knob Direction Y an independent commission along Z okay so sometimes

109
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:57,910
this will be convenient sometimes this

110
00:11:57,910 --> 00:12:02,610
 they are exactly the same thing that's  good

111
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:22,750
okay dependence relationship also in terms of sets of random variables so we can either

112
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:29,530
assent affection for environments is developing once that wagon easy when texas independent of Y

113
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:33,580
given Z for every X in the set X and

114
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:39,970
everyone in the sidewalk okay and actually this Zia can make it also set so

115
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:43,360
I maybe that we have been even

116
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:48,910
more generalized reversals in there now for example we say this set of the very

117
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:51,160
most is independent that given that set

118
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:58,770
 variable so this basically will follow  this definition here

119
00:12:58,770 --> 00:13:06,090
the repellents we listen to this sort of orthogonality condition but in some probability looks

120
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:11,190
mr. personality condition may imply something else usually defined in terms of expectations okay but

121
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:13,260
for us this is the notation we're

122
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:25,770
going to use muscle independence basically you know we take this definition for example means

123
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:34,320
of perfection y is given p FX he apply okay I was just looking at

124
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:39,690
this slide right you can stab it sometimes because you see for example have I'm

125
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:44,400
using the notation carrying them in a violent way but hopefully we can still get

126
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:49,500
the message for example you know here I lose capital X and wife on the

127
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:54,660
bottom was here in little x and y then effectively the same force but you

128
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:58,470
know traditionally this would be the lot of the volume or this will be the

129
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:03,810
values that are the vitamin can take but you know we're okay right we're not

130
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:07,980
gonna see you know sorry you with a little X you know it's gonna tell

131
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:13,470
you I type this slide at least we have some slides to talk about the

132
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:19,770
wrong papers you know it's good idea to sort of be careful and consistent because

133
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:29,370
much than you're consistent okay so this mess intent of this conditional and marginal independence

134
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:37,200
okay so I am saying here

135
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:46,230
 that this whole time is independent of  the type of the car okay

136
00:14:46,230 --> 00:15:04,249
[Music]

137
00:15:04,249 --> 00:16:08,249
I mean the you know they say the probability of a is higher is you

138
00:16:08,249 --> 00:16:14,150
know I mean they you know would be exactly the opposite effect from the first

139
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:22,139
example okay so so this is the motion again so we're gonna verse here you

140
00:16:22,139 --> 00:16:28,229
know I'm writing this is a standard are gonna spend actually two or three lectures

141
00:16:28,229 --> 00:16:32,970
discussing about this kindle market or

142
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:39,569
in the State Park Estate state-space models but this is a Markov chain so we

143
00:16:39,569 --> 00:16:43,439
can imagine you know you have some state

144
00:16:43,439 --> 00:16:52,650
body moves but and you know the values of it Connie so x1 is the

145
00:16:52,650 --> 00:17:01,050
volume of dynomonics - thank you it cetera so the unusually a monomial assumption here

146
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:06,030
where the model effects of high BP depends only on the value of I'm XT

147
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:10,800
minus 1 so prepared this expression show expecially we can remember this pretty does this

148
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:23,670
long expression compared list right with this Markovian model that is very simplified because extra

149
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:32,340
doesn't depend on XT minus 2 XT minus 3 etc ok so this is this

150
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:34,500
moment they see various cues the

151
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:44,280
independence relations in particular but XP is independent X 2 minus 1 is in the

152
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,200
parent of all the various values XT

153
00:17:46,200 --> 00:18:03,950
minus 2 X 1 on this course or something if I highlighted from lecture 1

154
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:09,540
which is the parent of the node right so in this case if we look

155
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:17,090
at no business to parents okay and so here's a fundamental

156
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:27,930
fairness conditionally previous relations for this directed graph and so what it says x-ray is

157
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:38,760
independent from the main the segments of a negative spiral so this is out there

158
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:44,680
Tamara trenched to emphasize the depositor given this will highlight in that movie alright so

159
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:47,410
the parlance it stays that the value of

160
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:55,540
V is independent through the name of the sender so photographer at the political order

161
00:18:55,540 --> 00:19:00,820
the wrong descendants will have numbers but they are basically everything about the values of

162
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:07,300
the parents basically in the order okay these are the non descendants right so point

163
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:09,420
on the values of the parents

164
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:20,230
excuse you the fella from the non-descendants eye or anything like that right so view

165
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:23,230
at this point I just want you to visualize as to what this means because

166
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:28,090
we love I think we should

167
00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:34,510
highlight that which is not very difficult but once you have this the composition for

168
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:38,980
probability defined on this graph you move rains pushing too hard okay so we will

169
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:45,430
able to take advantage of this relation so and no Pascal will ensure that only

170
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:47,140
distillation of the fertilizer in this

171
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:54,790
graph satisfies this relation and around this dilution on the graph this relation is also

172
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:56,560
satisfied you know I mean you

173
00:19:56,560 --> 00:20:10,950
 can see sorry  alright so both ways this will be okay

174
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:18,340
that the capitalization of the joint of immunity on the restive graph is written as

175
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:21,100
the product over all the nodes of the

176
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:27,490
graph of the conditional probabilities of X I excite the volume of you know the

177
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:31,600
I given the violence apart this is an

178
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:38,590
amazing between position if you think about it right so you know in this case

179
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:43,870
the conditional probability corresponding to its no and this function is the condition of the

180
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:52,930
way the effects are given its forests so mr. Bastian that factorization with this graph

181
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:57,159
the personal missile dependent relation that we introduced which is certified ethical justification for deewana

182
00:20:57,159 --> 00:21:03,220
and discuss its Lewis okay so I

183
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:07,029
will have exactly tricentennial examples and some a little bit more complicated but I'll ask

184
00:21:07,029 --> 00:21:14,049
you to know mrs. Blaine and

185
00:21:14,049 --> 00:21:20,200
 electric artworks and washing us if we  can prove it

186
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:28,379
[Music]

187
00:21:28,379 --> 00:21:40,060
Rises and this factors here these functions are the condition for committees of X i

188
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:44,440
given sparks when we have this complicated factorization from the product rule well we only

189
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:50,529
have the parents we have taught the settlers and the co parents and the novice

190
00:21:50,529 --> 00:21:58,720
and everything else is coming here but because of this independent relationship the the only

191
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:09,560
partition here this X i given the parents of

192
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:17,180
so I'm actually so sure what I'm doing I am taking a directed graph with

193
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:25,549
my body moves the first equation writes the the product rule so no independence assumptions

194
00:22:25,549 --> 00:22:31,430
I am love assuming nothing and then I am applying sort of this equation right

195
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:38,539
I'm applying this equation that says that business innovation is factorized this way and another

196
00:22:38,539 --> 00:22:42,649
thing at this the predominate affects one because it's one has no parents all right

197
00:22:42,649 --> 00:22:48,169
the prevent effects still given x1 that's the only part I could still get enough

198
00:22:48,169 --> 00:22:51,469
only x1 x4 given 2 and 3 and X 5 given 3 so remember you

199
00:22:51,469 --> 00:22:57,190
can see the appearance relations that

200
00:22:57,190 --> 00:23:02,779
effectively whether says the probability is equal to naught which means the level x3 expires

201
00:23:02,779 --> 00:23:07,519
in the penitent water I mean

202
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:15,710
looking at this 2 equation there never expiry x5 is independent off that's 124 right

203
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:19,310
there it's here given x2 x3 x4 is

204
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:22,789
independent of X 1 given X 1 X 3 in terms of X 2 etc

205
00:23:22,789 --> 00:23:34,219
you may say I know but

206
00:23:34,219 --> 00:23:49,610
 how do I know this independence relation  well we will spend a lecture or two and  we will

207
00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:57,410
cases

208
00:23:57,410 --> 00:25:28,410
it's okay you know this if let's say is the number of parents to the

209
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:33,310
power left to describe this times times

210
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:40,649
in principle actually somebody can say take the power a plus one 

211
00:25:40,649 --> 00:25:48,320
you sit up but you know it's like if you're comfortable a normalization and everything

212
00:25:48,320 --> 00:26:00,399
so that's approximately of the order wine is take aid to affect

213
00:26:00,399 --> 00:27:26,430
reverse right these are going to take a values and we're taking K values all  right so okay less rough

214
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:36,030
yes NZ's enemy remembrances lesser dismissed mara independence relations okay and this is not very

215
00:27:36,030 --> 00:28:58,500
interesting so this is something very just the Ascension this you can appreciate the necessary

216
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:15,090
I'm showing that this function is a  probability right because you say 116  points along that mystical did you okay

217
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:41,039
the distributions okay next one to experience equal to one which is nice so obviously

218
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:48,539
it's individual on normalizing expect that this will be the case and apparently this the

219
00:29:48,539 --> 00:30:10,259
composition here you can show that the national experience is actually it comes home service

220
00:30:10,259 --> 00:30:22,710
functions is really the conditional distribution which is what I tell you you need to

221
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:26,519
remember okay this functions are very more general and they don't even have to be

222
00:30:26,519 --> 00:30:33,570
preferable if this but right now from directed graphs this is the case and I

223
00:30:33,570 --> 00:30:37,740
say the proof and it works on extremely busy slide all right that's why I

224
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:45,779
want you to type your homework because this rule was the lazy person typing the

225
00:30:45,779 --> 00:30:54,659
slide my secretary the novelist which imaginary person alright so it was me okay because

226
00:30:54,659 --> 00:30:58,710
I can't imagine asking anybody that I've destroyed so it was this I want you

227
00:30:58,710 --> 00:31:06,680
to to need some type and by typing fails so

228
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:11,549
that because you will need to do this for specific distribution your homework to do

229
00:31:11,549 --> 00:31:16,649
things like that so the first part

230
00:31:16,649 --> 00:32:13,550
 of the theorem was methods and responses  individually

231
00:32:13,550 --> 00:32:25,399
[Music]

232
00:32:25,399 --> 00:32:38,310
the secrets wirelessly was one of the signals along okay sort of calculation that is

233
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:40,110
going to make the relations of

234
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:53,310
the article of all those extremely efficient okay define in terms of the notes and

235
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:58,680
the values of the parents minds within the operations rather in this case the marginalization

236
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:06,070
is a local operation right and this allows us to to  see immediately the distance

237
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:54,410
it's his Michigan the normalized properly okay okay mr. as I say those any functions

238
00:33:54,410 --> 00:34:01,330
like that take the permanent zone distribution well I'm going to show you know that

239
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:08,450
this and some of the various I write lists as the joint effects k plus

240
00:34:08,450 --> 00:34:10,760
1 and the quality k plus 1 divided by the powers of k plus 1

241
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:15,770
and then I I calculate the numerator

242
00:34:15,770 --> 00:34:35,830
 denominator using the appropriate  marginalization of the composition of  the joint of a new distribution

243
00:34:35,830 --> 00:35:13,680
expansion sure whatever done

244
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:54,700
okay okay okay so this is the okay mr. Lucius okay because that's positive wearing

245
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:56,950
dark shirt and whatever else on

246
00:35:56,950 --> 00:36:21,540
 the proctors so let's take this one and  the partnership give you some k plus and

247
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:26,890
and because I have to forensic aware that if L doesn't create the pilots of

248
00:36:26,890 --> 00:36:30,760
k plus 1 is inside before camp yesterday right so I don't have to worry

249
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:37,540
about the parent and mr. McCann needed to learn outside the estimation because I don't

250
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:40,600
samel XK plus one or departments and you

251
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:46,510
notice from here to there I have to sound and the professionals from 1 to

252
00:36:46,510 --> 00:36:58,200
K except the parts of campus where  elements will be possible  explain right there without a freshwater

253
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:05,830
because this is something extremely important right because I'm doing I'm pushing the summations inside

254
00:37:05,830 --> 00:37:13,420
I have a context that the potentials are okay according to my induction argument they're

255
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:16,870
really the conditional distributions and then I have this summation of the other factors that

256
00:37:16,870 --> 00:37:25,810
have no clear benefit so if you do this and we move this on the

257
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:31,690
local what you have to summon XK plus 1 because there's no X 2 plus

258
00:37:31,690 --> 00:37:41,110
1 so this whole transformation constants numerator denominator D summation constants and this factorization by

259
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:45,970
definition is 1 because this functions are normalized so what I get is this conditional

260
00:37:45,970 --> 00:37:53,430
distribution is equal to my factor FK plus 1 so as you

261
00:37:53,430 --> 00:38:05,080
compose in revenue distribution in terms of conditionals the proof is not shortened to contagious

262
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:10,980
is like traffic AIDS ok actually most books the parties consider a logician there's no

263
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:23,200
proof okay inaudible any questions on this thing's right if another story our interest is

264
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:30,310
really the decomposition in terms of these local conscious that their conditional the values of

265
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:37,390
exodus 12 given its parents the resumption topology will here the destructor fundamental to the

266
00:38:37,390 --> 00:38:43,330
type of things we do this with directed graph and the part that we have

267
00:38:43,330 --> 00:38:48,840
it illogical or derivative is decelerations and insulation don't imagine that they have to sound

268
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:54,260
x1 an actual appears in all of these  functions

269
00:38:54,260 --> 00:39:01,850
myself but the tractor fixed islands only on the bottom here exclusively there right so

270
00:39:01,850 --> 00:39:05,810
obviously in this problems you can start some you provide to the left all right

271
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:10,760
and if examples as you see this so

272
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:15,380
that's important and then you'll notice you have some operations to put rods and notes

273
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:18,500
where we sum up although the rest

274
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:24,380
of the body most this is so focused on the operation we we have to

275
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:37,310
do with a glass with left of model stressing the context of why not kids

276
00:39:37,310 --> 00:39:41,300
like the different there is a problem to the complex all right I'm I always

277
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:44,960
like the opposite of the normal

278
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:50,330
case right I remember you know I said maybe this joke some time ago I

279
00:39:50,330 --> 00:39:56,390
was trying to give a whole action on some topic and some people ask me

280
00:39:56,390 --> 00:40:01,570
can you start to give an example and I have not been introduced what the

281
00:40:01,570 --> 00:40:07,130
topic was okay you know she'll never leave my case alive to give you the

282
00:40:07,130 --> 00:40:13,040
period when the examples come later on he do the examples on your own so

283
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:17,030
yes sort of the people in one day so extra depends on X 1 X

284
00:40:17,030 --> 00:40:29,780
2 X 2 etc so you can see I say okay

285
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:37,130
of the write this as a product of the functions but intellectual inspires this is

286
00:40:37,130 --> 00:40:40,430
nothing then experian the partner physics wonder next year and the pharmacist our experience it's

287
00:40:40,430 --> 00:40:45,920
for the next three so the other ones you can show you at least the

288
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:51,290
service functions they are nothing else or the the function of P of X clinics

289
00:40:51,290 --> 00:40:59,590
still is when the condition of x3 given x2 and I think mr. composition right

290
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:07,610
and I I you know the country first I have to calculate the joint if

291
00:41:07,610 --> 00:41:10,940
X to X T divided by T FX still so then the other thing I

292
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:13,430
have to some obviously to marginalize

293
00:41:13,430 --> 00:41:20,570
it's all X 1 X 2 X 4 or X 1 and X 4 and

294
00:41:20,570 --> 00:41:22,670
you can see some of the things we'll

295
00:41:22,670 --> 00:41:30,320
organization can see long distance inside the trial and these parenthesis and visible practice comes

296
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:33,530
too long to learn good idea to is f 3 or X 3 and X

297
00:41:33,530 --> 00:41:43,610
3 just is like a turbulent completed version of the theorem okay the best possible

298
00:41:43,610 --> 00:41:48,050
functions right and this conscience turn out to be pro communities is only for directed

299
00:41:48,050 --> 00:41:56,990
graphs we said anything for undirected graphs the case to be very well general management

300
00:41:56,990 --> 00:42:02,990
of sanity can position at least in the context of this Markov chain about adoption

301
00:42:02,990 --> 00:42:16,310
being a bit more powerful so this is an example from one of the textbook

302
00:42:16,310 --> 00:42:28,940
similar in machine learning so one of the notes is the glass is left one

303
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:31,460
of the knowledge is the support which can be on the left the other one

304
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:33,920
is a know that is raining

305
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:43,010
which can be on earth and everyone is that it's cloudy I am a strong

306
00:42:43,010 --> 00:42:49,040
basically the dependencies look like the hot all right and let's follow the fuel that

307
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:58,730
I described the junket ability of drama straight away the grass right is basically returnest

308
00:42:58,730 --> 00:43:05,090
same time first even see we're forgiven see what not really given us an hour

309
00:43:05,090 --> 00:43:13,700
and everything you can see by comparing this with examining the composition using the product

310
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:22,100
community to share is implies basically fundamental national independence relations right and as a measure

311
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:43,250
of the elections okay right that

312
00:43:43,250 --> 00:43:48,530
you can this you can expect this independence relations all right and then from this

313
00:43:48,530 --> 00:43:51,260
you can say oh that's why

314
00:43:51,260 --> 00:43:59,030
the composition I mean in Pascal the new activist problem and you have this graph

315
00:43:59,030 --> 00:44:00,770
like that smells you already have a

316
00:44:00,770 --> 00:44:06,560
negative in the graphics independence relations so this decomposition is automatic you don't have to

317
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:29,390
clear anything right so we are going to define this distribution so effectively the trial

318
00:44:29,390 --> 00:44:34,910
value well because of an organization to define this is from his first loudest row

319
00:44:34,910 --> 00:44:37,490
so if I do he wanted

320
00:44:37,490 --> 00:44:43,340
as long as the other one is one line is nervously than one value let's

321
00:44:43,340 --> 00:44:49,280
say this is the probability of the specular the hell are they so I am

322
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:55,230
writing is probability well the cloud is a false argument or a tool to describe

323
00:44:55,230 --> 00:45:01,680
this well actually I have no

324
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:05,850
money from this I have to fill this I have different Lee's and if I

325
00:45:05,850 --> 00:45:15,270
take this little mini be how isn't it okay we come from the normalization because

326
00:45:15,270 --> 00:45:19,530
for a lot of skilled problem it doesn't make a sense to say - wah

327
00:45:19,530 --> 00:45:24,600
- wah yeah we can subtract - fish - a problem with million borrowers we

328
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:30,859
will make a difference okay so no bother so I spent the card for this

329
00:45:30,859 --> 00:45:35,430
problem is the times to the

330
00:45:35,430 --> 00:45:44,690
carry case the number of points below and this environment variables that's why you see

331
00:45:44,690 --> 00:45:52,230
it through there actually I don't know why I different from before before using were

332
00:45:52,230 --> 00:45:56,190
using K from the number of values that are available can take here I just

333
00:45:56,190 --> 00:46:02,010
a for another opponent the game you guys are adult and vaccinated so you can

334
00:46:02,010 --> 00:46:06,480
figure out in which life what the context is right so so I don't have

335
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:17,130
to go back and change the story that's already there and I was sure that

336
00:46:17,130 --> 00:46:24,270
everybody responds what this equation makes or let's the the correlation rate across today from

337
00:46:24,270 --> 00:46:26,670
directly ghost makes a little sense

338
00:46:26,670 --> 00:46:38,710
 there was nothing else okay all right

339
00:46:38,710 --> 00:46:47,040
so this 11 example I think I'm gonna I may have to give this because there's

340
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:57,960
unpleasant dependence relations from this example as applications in the slides so this is prevalence

341
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:06,040
of you know to come you know sometime in the near part of a future

342
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:10,809
so there are such variables and best on with the discussion of in the composition

343
00:47:10,809 --> 00:47:14,470
this is what I have right x1 x2 given x1 x3 given X 1 X

344
00:47:14,470 --> 00:47:19,030
5 etc X tix given X 2 X 5

345
00:47:19,030 --> 00:47:29,859
protected right and and you say in this example a nice graphical representation of the

346
00:47:29,859 --> 00:47:34,839
table society to this conditional distribution is corresponding to each tsunami so x1 it's a

347
00:47:34,839 --> 00:47:39,520
long experience given x1 so it's a baby like this exports given x2 table like

348
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:46,870
this exist given two values okay it's a table like that and like that I

349
00:47:46,870 --> 00:47:53,430
have to actually program I'm assuming and I'm saying this that show the kid and

350
00:47:53,430 --> 00:47:57,670
take note and destroy that we assign you some homework problems when we don't do

351
00:47:57,670 --> 00:48:05,730
the question all right you have something only  computer program to do this for you

352
00:48:05,730 --> 00:48:13,920
don't eat this don't eat this already did this Antoni gaudí

353
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:23,250
okay guys there's a time for them how's that possible I don't have the power

354
00:48:23,250 --> 00:48:30,030
you know why not a very good machine ever left of their other thing you

355
00:48:30,030 --> 00:48:40,440
guys left me because you'll never never go almost papers right that's the 30 minutes

356
00:48:40,440 --> 00:49:00,360
all right let's see necessarily put so I'm going  to my past

357
00:49:00,360 --> 00:50:10,390
and okay so which of the sexist is coming all right so then this is

358
00:50:10,390 --> 00:50:18,540
our independent of each other and that's the concept of the latest Paris fire okay

359
00:50:18,540 --> 00:50:24,490
so so it's my NRI all right this are independent if I didn't know why

360
00:50:24,490 --> 00:50:30,070
they're nervous values of X 1 and X 4 whatever I get they depend on

361
00:50:30,070 --> 00:50:34,540
each other this is sort of a song another problem will reduce you know in

362
00:50:34,540 --> 00:50:41,819
in sort of mixed models but many other settings as well  okay

363
00:50:41,819 --> 00:50:46,979
two things - one and two long is this Belgium to mislead Gaussian so if

364
00:50:46,979 --> 00:50:53,609
I wrote a little bit of white for it sex the this exercising defendant and

365
00:50:53,609 --> 00:50:58,829
so effectively you know this is the problem engine roaring tons of the divinity of

366
00:50:58,829 --> 00:51:02,039
the world X given Y and the lamented

367
00:51:02,039 --> 00:51:07,469
world X living who soldier sex is given Y can be factorized over the data

368
00:51:07,469 --> 00:51:15,209
right because of this assumption that the X is having a fairly given Y ok

369
00:51:15,209 --> 00:51:19,259
so so this is something very important laughter moment of birth under the name of

370
00:51:19,259 --> 00:51:22,979
naive Bayes classifier i mean i

371
00:51:22,979 --> 00:51:35,699
satisfy a fear you know i know this but additionally basically has been this is

372
00:51:35,699 --> 00:51:38,039
that that's fine to say become from now

373
00:51:38,039 --> 00:51:49,799
someone and thousand through so that's what the name plus pi or take this complexed

374
00:51:49,799 --> 00:51:55,799
and say the sections are linearly independent given y and you notice on this paragraph

375
00:51:55,799 --> 00:51:59,880
if you see on the birthday all right I started fatal dependencies between the exes

376
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:03,900
okay so this is the display the

377
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:12,359
printed my Vegas was fired okay to come up with your own little algorithms and

378
00:52:12,359 --> 00:52:17,279
this if you search in the literature you

379
00:52:17,279 --> 00:52:27,839
will find very particular algorithm it's for leveling this demented name they discussed fire okay

380
00:52:27,839 --> 00:52:31,680
yes well I just know if you remember that name basements that these types of

381
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:38,610
sex running right and independent so you have a nice proposition that looks like this

382
00:52:38,610 --> 00:52:47,040
okay and constants with dependencies between the extras and because the balance is still maintained

383
00:52:47,040 --> 00:53:04,430
some pay structure that you can do is the difference but the  custom what you see on the top okay

384
00:53:04,430 --> 00:53:23,250
it's prevalent conditional independence relations National Defense relations so these actions right so this is

385
00:53:23,250 --> 00:53:28,860
all right this is the length of appearances this is referred directly best luck sir

386
00:53:28,860 --> 00:53:37,140
okay and the party dependencies we have this one we introduced the Vegas more longer

387
00:53:37,140 --> 00:53:39,900
in about two legs from now so you can

388
00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:46,220
 work from something from collective one  connected personal between the first

389
00:53:46,220 --> 00:53:57,700
okay there is nothing new there

390
00:53:57,700 --> 00:56:13,360
but I am descendants even the parents then the descendants even the parents  and

391
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:23,480
accept the fact the fundamental property of directed graphs the different position from the parable

392
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:31,220
sprouts to convince your sensitive actually again the fulfilled never step two is this marginalization

393
00:56:31,220 --> 00:56:40,810
that we did in two examples before and then you can treat  this decomposition is correct

394
00:56:40,810 --> 00:57:57,530
[Music]

395
00:57:57,530 --> 00:58:27,020
one extreme

396
00:58:27,020 --> 00:58:34,280
experts in the time of x1 x2 and there's not wrong exterior to this efficient

397
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:40,319
right

398
00:58:40,319 --> 00:58:47,920
- okay listen tada your life is perfect when it's the expected by P of

399
00:58:47,920 --> 00:59:00,430
X 1 is 50 ok by you

400
00:59:00,430 --> 00:59:03,370
alpha plus X 1 X 2 X 3 X 4 is that what happens to

401
00:59:03,370 --> 00:59:07,469
X 5 and X 6 fear of insulin

402
00:59:07,469 --> 00:59:15,700
what happened to X 5 minus X 6 well I mean the question of attack

403
00:59:15,700 --> 00:59:20,469
the black is words you know when you somewhere X 5 and X 6 this

404
00:59:20,469 --> 00:59:26,859
is 0.1 of this equal to 1 so they disappear you see that when you

405
00:59:26,859 --> 00:59:32,319
analyze to the joint the next 5 minutes because this how conditional distinguishes the summation

406
00:59:32,319 --> 00:59:37,870
is giving the advantage okay so so this

407
00:59:37,870 --> 00:59:41,049
is the joint of X 1 X 2 X 3 X 4 and then if

408
00:59:41,049 --> 00:59:42,700
you wanted to join the pitch 1 X 2 X

409
00:59:42,700 --> 00:59:50,170
3 we have to something that's clear but when someone experimenting disappearing because summation of

410
00:59:50,170 --> 00:59:55,690
expelling everyone all right yeah well this consus without this concept evolved already but you

411
00:59:55,690 --> 01:00:01,019
get this perfect score given X 2 okay so this is kinda filled this independence

412
01:00:01,019 --> 01:00:08,200
relation but I wrestle to remember the ideas that Assad isn't behind all of this

413
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:12,940
and say all there is an independence relations but to heaven all the groups of

414
01:00:12,940 --> 01:00:21,339
this graph and he says this graph implies none of this independence relations so whatever

415
01:00:21,339 --> 01:00:25,769
distribution that population the graph has been tamarkan satisfy of this relationship okay a stupid

416
01:00:25,769 --> 01:00:28,690
idea so we're not going to

417
01:00:28,690 --> 01:00:38,640
 do the algebra but we lived  that vision server browser arguments  implants University what is relationship

418
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:44,650
and here is an over in the Paris relation X 1 given X 6 is

419
01:00:44,650 --> 01:01:31,660
the head of X 3 X 3 this is like in the in this case

420
01:01:31,660 --> 01:01:36,000
of disease that say cancer and why is

421
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:43,990
somehow kind of a disease you know some of molecule blood or other things so

422
01:01:43,990 --> 01:01:50,170
why is the disease right but the memory access many diseases and you have something

423
01:01:50,170 --> 01:01:52,089
that can be derived from any

424
01:01:52,089 --> 01:02:02,740
diseases so you can see this as a little from X to Y so exist

425
01:02:02,740 --> 01:02:07,329
another thing the - you can see this is awareness problem that if you have

426
01:02:07,329 --> 01:02:08,770
an alternate and let's say a blood test you ask the members area and so

427
01:02:08,770 --> 01:02:12,670
this graph that you see in

428
01:02:12,670 --> 01:02:23,050
spitzer discuss you know this isn't about the narrative rondelle the joint affection Y as

429
01:02:23,050 --> 01:02:30,400
the probable effects knives the probability of Y given X so reliable addressed you know

430
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:36,280
this you know the parent effects may be will  define it by

431
01:02:36,280 --> 01:03:49,460
right right okay

432
01:03:49,460 --> 01:03:59,350
[Music]

433
01:03:59,350 --> 01:04:04,640
delicious from X to Y but that doesn't allow you can be any friends res

434
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:13,430
or something for y and say what desserts  okay

435
01:04:13,430 --> 01:06:17,520
they delivered the next two slides we will discuss and rain

436
01:06:17,520 --> 01:07:42,450
okay right okay so this is the right

437
01:07:42,450 --> 01:07:58,380
[Music]

438
01:07:58,380 --> 01:08:22,980

442
01:09:34,829 --> 01:09:44,320
this has already explained that the grass is wet okay we will formally serve this

443
01:09:44,320 --> 01:09:57,990
with a derivation okay but in essence if this  example all right

444
01:09:57,990 --> 01:10:11,569
no problems maybe today

445
01:10:11,569 --> 01:10:17,990
with little names let's say you have two points the students are doing the kind

446
01:10:17,990 --> 01:10:22,490
of it thank you go gents you know come

447
01:10:22,490 --> 01:10:51,010
to get doesn't depend on anything so they're putting the feather corns let's say this

448
01:10:51,010 --> 01:11:07,910
and this right so let's Alchemist is right this is zero okay so this has

449
01:11:07,910 --> 01:11:16,640
exploratory they so right so this is Center for the experiment a  phenomenal

450
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:24,920
I was reporting this in the slides you know losing the game in the factorization

451
01:11:24,920 --> 01:11:31,460
which we miss you can actually compute an audience and do the algebra nothing Ranger

452
01:11:31,460 --> 01:11:35,900
so this is the factorization we started so you can actually prove all the questions

453
01:11:35,900 --> 01:11:56,239
that you saw in the previous slides

454
01:11:56,239 --> 01:12:02,839
my ass Douglas relation so let me just say what's going easier so remember we

455
01:12:02,839 --> 01:12:11,899
sent that you know X of the royal

456
01:12:11,899 --> 01:12:25,729
descendants okay so basically the board is independent of anything else okay the SAT score

457
01:12:25,729 --> 01:12:29,000
or what rate is clearing out

458
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:37,689
 that cetera  question on the doctor okay it says

459
01:12:37,689 --> 01:12:45,770
parasocial was given them the difficulty of an exam all right it's also kind of

460
01:12:45,770 --> 01:12:50,410
hell okay that's not what I wrote it

461
01:12:50,410 --> 01:12:57,480
however informational says about its descendants

462
01:12:57,480 --> 01:13:06,300
well so long I just want the sentence against not breathing with an equation any

463
01:13:06,300 --> 01:13:12,360
information about the descendants contains beliefs about this invention reasoning process so another race if

464
01:13:12,360 --> 01:13:23,280
you know what happened was still there it has got there okay it changes the

465
01:13:23,280 --> 01:13:27,630
picture okay even who says the difficulty on the intelligence of the Skinner right if

466
01:13:27,630 --> 01:13:34,980
the evidence is the difficulty of in Excel and even peasants sugar still smells but

467
01:13:34,980 --> 01:13:40,790
the official from below the most immortality do the fixer okay so we will see

468
01:13:40,790 --> 01:14:09,940
this sort of problem when we discuss  independence relationships and and  evidence okay

469
01:14:09,940 --> 01:14:21,140

[Music]

474
01:15:14,210 --> 01:15:22,190
and this would be the growth and the logo is this image on just the

475
01:15:22,190 --> 01:15:30,210
mission we have sent up over all the she's invaluable success okay so then this

476
01:15:30,210 --> 01:15:31,830
have the visceral volume is the Sabbath

477
01:15:31,830 --> 01:15:36,270
even vartanus and this is sort of the main cost that allows you develop native

478
01:15:36,270 --> 01:15:40,080
environments now the only thing I was

479
01:15:40,080 --> 01:15:47,940
gonna say is a little socially desirable but Sir I was seven gardeners there was

480
01:15:47,940 --> 01:15:50,070
the number of mobile growth so

481
01:15:50,070 --> 01:15:57,240
we can think of a gradual and that way the death of our decisions coming

482
01:15:57,240 --> 01:16:08,670
so the killer virus can be maybe indicator punch values that tells you what it's

483
01:16:08,670 --> 01:16:17,970
beautiful collect - what Gaussian envelopes are they too late or what you know okay

484
01:16:17,970 --> 01:16:22,260
so life is the composition is right that this hidden garden was the morning with

485
01:16:22,260 --> 01:16:34,580
a number of the additional volume which in the graph  you can keep the prosperous

486
01:16:34,580 --> 01:16:45,180
service parameters theta are independent but independent of the data you collect in the problem

487
01:16:45,180 --> 01:16:49,890
okay sure and in real problems here in the formation of the rebels will go

488
01:16:49,890 --> 01:17:03,830
to be able to achieve is a testament to this  data parameters theta but this bottom of

489
01:17:03,830 --> 01:17:15,030
missions to carefully account for the factors and somehow instance you have to do predictions

490
01:17:15,030 --> 01:17:40,260
by information of the students to know is nobody here in a few weeks from

491
01:17:40,260 --> 01:17:42,420
now but because not wait a

492
01:17:42,420 --> 01:17:51,090
minute and the very natural self directly linked to my website at least the previous

493
01:17:51,090 --> 01:17:59,280
one and this nice already aware and I will see here on next  Tuesday suppose
