00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:10,740
throughout this part we supposed to start obviously you realize the lectures are videotaped that's

1
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:17,550
why I have to start exactly 1213 I suppose I have your permission with the

2
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:20,430
tape here we are not actually in the video but if you say anything also

3
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:22,310
you don't have to worry because

4
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:29,310
it's not going to pick you up very micro points which made but the lectures

5
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:38,870
are going to be videotaped and posted on the  website of the course and also on what's  the system

6
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:44,760
but you know we put the lectures from YouTube so you can download them directly

7
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:48,960
from the next notes the course

8
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:56,580
website it's an under construction which means it's only the link is there the rest

9
00:01:56,580 --> 00:02:00,060
is going to be up when I managed to

10
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:08,520
get some sleep of 12 hours deadlock okay so maybe tomorrow or something you know

11
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:14,940
certainly before the next lecture I hope to have this thing up with today's lecture

12
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:22,550
and video as well let's see the glass is Tuesdays and Thursdays 12:32 unqualified I

13
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:29,430
know there has been lots of changes from the timing it's really not something I

14
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:34,470
control when you use the lecture room like 126 the Bartolo that has videotaping you

15
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:43,199
know everybody wants this room so it's very difficult to watch that yes everything is

16
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:50,520
on yeah thank you thanks for stopping by so this room is on high demand

17
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:53,610
so we were in then we were out in and out so we are in

18
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:57,660
as of today the Baku next

19
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:05,309
rescue station first place and maybe not every Friday but once a while we're going

20
00:03:05,309 --> 00:03:07,020
to have recitations to get we've

21
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:12,690
helped with a homework and in addition when there are missing lecture I'm going to

22
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:16,789
use cry this to cover up for that so

23
00:03:16,789 --> 00:03:23,369
let's see what else that's my email address whatever information you need I want to

24
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:25,319
try to provide it on the course

25
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:38,099
website okay there's a lots of there you know regarding the course objectives this is

26
00:03:38,099 --> 00:03:41,880
not an application course right that don't usually teach application of courses so Vista course

27
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:50,039
on the fundamentals of community graphical modules and I remember someone's had asked me in

28
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:54,830
the past you know what's probabilistic graphical models thinking must be something graphical you know

29
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:56,970
probably the graphical models is a

30
00:03:56,970 --> 00:04:03,330
constant yet is a way to work with many random variables and if you think

31
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:10,110
this many of the valuable some somehow interconnected because they are correlated there is a

32
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:15,059
graph and then maybe we can do some graph theoretic approaches to doing transpose but

33
00:04:15,059 --> 00:04:19,560
don't expect to have a problem where there is a graph and then you say

34
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:24,480
oh do something with this graph the graph is there all right so you have

35
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:28,830
to think of something being represented as a graph and I think it comes tense

36
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:32,860
that's the most difficult part of of the of the cost being able to actually

37
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:36,939
visualize on how what is a good

38
00:04:36,939 --> 00:04:44,350
model to represent the relations between many other body okay so I'm going to try

39
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:48,040
to give you all the fundamentals to do

40
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:56,140
inference in graphs and when I talk about the interest rate refer to Bayesian inference

41
00:04:56,140 --> 00:05:05,219
I'm going to discuss both directed and undirected graphs maybe people in social science do

42
00:05:05,219 --> 00:05:10,839
psychology they like directed graph people in science and engineering the like undirected graphs but

43
00:05:10,839 --> 00:05:16,860
we've received some how we can connect the different types of graphs we learned one

44
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:23,170
all the types quite easily obviously you

45
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:32,499
know I'm going to give you examples here and there represent the potential of using

46
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:40,240
graphical models from standard machine learning problems the computer vision to doing scientific computing two

47
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:51,909
certifications of natural language processing computational biology I don't  believe we have anybody from biology the  audience do we  okay

48
00:05:51,909 --> 00:05:59,170
obviously nobody does anything related to the type of things so we don't have anything

49
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:06,520
any contributions from students this year right well the course is appropriate basically for students

50
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:15,010
in math statistics and computer science for students in engineering that have good mathematical skills

51
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:23,140
but very relevant and students in all areas of time this including cognitive sciences biology

52
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:29,379
if it's called chemical etc some of this course is to not universally so popular

53
00:06:29,379 --> 00:06:31,149
I'd noticed for example you go to

54
00:06:31,149 --> 00:06:37,059
Stanford the cost is more than click on the students attending again because there is

55
00:06:37,059 --> 00:06:41,050
interest from every direction ok here

56
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:45,429
you have the selective ones are not the same we have the carrots to come

57
00:06:45,429 --> 00:06:49,899
and attend these lectures to Delhi and I hope to see you on with the

58
00:06:49,899 --> 00:06:54,730
next lecture on Thursday as well okay and I hope to see you the day

59
00:06:54,730 --> 00:07:00,070
after I give the first homework because usually that's when the class population goes down

60
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:11,980
by 50% okay now B this is not that caused us to get four credits

61
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:16,420
I am assuming you only reason you're here is because you want to learn the

62
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:18,579
topic and integrated with your research and I'm going to help you in doing that

63
00:07:18,579 --> 00:07:20,920
but if you just need four

64
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:26,439
credits this is on the right course for you okay I want to you know

65
00:07:26,439 --> 00:07:32,559
this is a very hot important area in many ways and I'm going to educate

66
00:07:32,559 --> 00:07:36,440
you but to be able to learn this you need to have and interest from

67
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:39,670
the top if you don't this is not the place to be now the cost

68
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:43,610
you know it's going to be

69
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:49,940
one of the core courses from the new center for informatics and computational science is

70
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:57,470
basically the second in sequence from a course to PI I taught on Bayesian statistics

71
00:07:57,470 --> 00:08:04,310
in the fall if you don't really need the previous course and if you need

72
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:07,880
something well I mean when I say you don't need it you need everything right

73
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:13,310
the more you know the better but I cannot expect you that you know what

74
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:18,620
was covered to the previous course so when there are some fundamental concepts that we

75
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:23,570
need to bring in I will either cover them in this course where I will

76
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:28,640
give you know it's basically to read about them I think and it is possible

77
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:35,150
that I'm gonna go back to you some of the topics covered in the poll

78
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:41,810
anyways but try to address them in a graph theoretic wonder okay so new algorithmic

79
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:53,570
problems we cover for example related to data stimulation so you need to know probability

80
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:59,540
theory you don't know anything about probabilities period will disappoint you you need to know

81
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:10,610
the fundamentals at least Vegas rules and the lights about Bayesian inference and if we

82
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:18,320
have taken even an introductory cost to must in learning may be useful okay machine

83
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:23,269
learning for me means computational statistics so whatever we need I will bring it back

84
00:09:23,269 --> 00:09:27,300
for your convenience but it is going to

85
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:32,180
be helpful if you have a book in your desk but you can look for

86
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:40,500
information okay and I'm going to give you lots of readings that you can go

87
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:45,720
through this semester and also after the course is over you need to know programming

88
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,060
because we will make an effort every

89
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:54,480
homework didn't have a computational problem and we're going to try to do this even

90
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,860
on the first homework these are the first home mortgage deduction calculations but what going

91
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:06,180
sort of to try to give you a computer assignment simply because we you know

92
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:11,370
we want to precise this because that these computers is not to do ten calculations

93
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:15,780
there's too much you know computation

94
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:26,520
 and ten calculations were not tempted to  do any serious problems okay all right

95
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:32,670
like in the fall semester of relying on the help from others around the court

96
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:37,650
so dr. Rubik Chakraborty this neck you

97
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:45,180
know the over there with his mark is going is volunteering to help with some

98
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:49,140
of the vegetation preparing some of the

99
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:53,790
homework solutions and also doing some of the grading and so he's gone around the

100
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:56,940
resistance and maybe once if I give

101
00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:08,460
a lecture or two when I'm out of town so the homework is going to

102
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:12,750
be submitted electronically to this email address I'm going to provide more information on the

103
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,880
website in the cover that you need to

104
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:20,190
submit the homework this address may change actually by tomorrow that's why I said this

105
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:23,070
email address this is a Google

106
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:32,370
 email account but you may have made  design one just for this class okay

107
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:38,040
I notice some of you look worn oh yes you know we like typed homework

108
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:44,640
because it is for me especially computational silence and writing by 10:00 there's no way

109
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,440
we can figure out what you're

110
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:51,150
writing there if you write if you type something nice to me it is very

111
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:55,500
easy to know what is going on okay so indeed with preferred type homework but

112
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:58,350
some of your lazy and I'm referring

113
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:04,890
to my students my own students so for those who are lazy you can stop

114
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:09,780
the you can stick on your homework and stormy if there's a PDF attachment okay

115
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:13,920
if you do this thing's might can't ask me you will identify 90% of the

116
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:18,540
mistakes in your homework just by typing it slowly and looking at it say oh

117
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:24,600
it doesn't look good and it doesn't look good mint is wrong okay but if

118
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,390
you tied by hand it never looks good so you never have lost is it

119
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:31,350
right because most of the time is

120
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:38,070
wrong okay so we learnt that convert not to mention you know what if you

121
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:42,660
type this nice 3 tomorrow you go for a job interview and you say yeah

122
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:49,910
I took this course and here is what I did and that counts a lot

123
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:56,010
ok because this is not intro to happy hour type of port let's see the

124
00:12:56,010 --> 00:13:01,770
information on how you have to uch your homeworks and how to name

125
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:07,730
touch your homeworks and how to name your submission again sir I will give that

126
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:15,540
information of the website MOOCs I'm gonna start actually in different orders from what is

127
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:22,810
given here the this book by Michael Jordan and introductions published graphical models is actually

128
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:31,930
what is used in most universities for breeding and it's actually turtlecom you know everybody's

129
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:40,269
taste in preparation reprint this book has been in preparation for 25 years which means

130
00:13:40,269 --> 00:13:44,740
professor jonathan has given up basically because things are changing so rapidly it's like what's

131
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:53,230
the point of finishing this book now okay and so versus actually the easiest and

132
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:58,000
the most insightful reading that you can have and for those who register in the

133
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:03,360
course I am going to send you a PDF so I shouldn't be saying this

134
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:15,220
on faith somehow you've been going to library find it okay all right the let's

135
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:21,130
see if you really want to do research in this area a heavy book that

136
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:25,540
you need to have in your desk is the textbook by Colin is written is

137
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:33,490
more than a thousand pages maybe 1,200 pages has a lot of information some we

138
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:39,519
will cover it in this course in detail some all the details you don't need

139
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:45,670
them but toughen the vistas the state of the art both in theory and algorithms

140
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:55,960
so business you know recommended book basically or you know to have the the textbook

141
00:14:55,960 --> 00:15:04,630
that we usually fit last fall by Kevin Rushdie has you know it's like an

142
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:09,610
encyclopedia of machine learning it's not really a readable text book but it has lots

143
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:14,980
of new algorithm still much more modern Abroad's and it has a structural also that

144
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:16,990
goes with all the examples in the

145
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:31,120
book which I recommend it right and it is actually less probabilistic than for example

146
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:36,220
Jordan's reprint okay it used likes to use point estimates for fast inference for most

147
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:42,670
of the algorithms but you know there are I don't know six seven chapters are

148
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:47,230
thinking for published graphical models and we will cover at least the essential parts of

149
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:50,920
those this of just one chapter

150
00:15:50,920 --> 00:16:00,040
on probabilistic graphical models that is actually an ideal read if you want to know

151
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:02,740
everything about this court before we even start to get a good stance let's say

152
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:06,519
this week is to read what's after is

153
00:16:06,519 --> 00:16:15,930
it a a so if you're in separate even just without the details alright just

154
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:18,370
going through it it would serve you

155
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:25,329
extremely well because it has everything not loops or anything like that but has the

156
00:16:25,329 --> 00:16:26,740
lots of insights as to what

157
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:34,990
probabilistic graphical models are and how to go about okay so certainly this would be

158
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:43,199
a good start point and also if he has the cube has many other things

159
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:51,590
that utilized the machinery of probabilistic graphical models that we will also use in this

160
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:55,850
course 16 readable most probably the most readable book on machine learning in the market

161
00:16:55,850 --> 00:17:00,770
and even watched about 20 years tall you will find it I pressed when I

162
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:03,110
read it every other day I

163
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:14,170
find something new there okay and so I obviously I recommend all of this book

164
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:16,640
okay grading so we're going to have six

165
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:22,670
homework the homework will be 60% of the grades and it be a project 40%

166
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:31,090
for some maybe that's too much you know but if you think about it no

167
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:36,980
exams no meters no finals nothing okay so this is a gradual course we don't

168
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:41,360
operate the classical way but the expectations are higher than giving an example you write

169
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:49,070
something wrong page that say congratulations we pass the course right so the project it

170
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:53,810
the program we have to change the leave it from those who took the course

171
00:17:53,810 --> 00:17:59,830
in in the poll because I was very disappointed with the attitude of many students

172
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:05,660
here when it comes to the course to the project I get freedom to everybody

173
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:09,950
to define their own project relevant to the course and I can tell you there

174
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:16,370
were at least seven students who came up with a new definition of the project

175
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:22,670
about three days before the presentation I mean asked not normal just ridiculous okay so

176
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:27,380
so I don't know exactly how

177
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:32,420
we're going to do it but I'm gonna think in the next two or three

178
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:37,310
weeks but the possibility would be to actually literally five you ten twenty projects and

179
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:39,710
save it to Z and here are the

180
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:44,520
references become whatever you like and do one of those and you cannot say right

181
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:50,740
well we may do it as last fall but

182
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:56,470
with strict guidelines that you changed project means you get zero breaking your project we

183
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:58,810
cannot allow basically a week before

184
00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:05,440
the representation solidifying what the project is and I'm not talking about the trying a

185
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:10,170
little bit I'm talking about going from A to Z okay not to mention going

186
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:12,790
from A to Z and SIF having no

187
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:20,560
relation to the course at all right so that's number I take so certainly I

188
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:24,190
want with the project to give you an opportunity to do something that is relevant

189
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:27,570
to your research right so that

190
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:31,810
not only you benefit because you learn the material of the course for those strong

191
00:19:31,810 --> 00:19:34,720
you benefit because the course in

192
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:45,880
fact you're already served and that's very important okay so now because of so the

193
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:48,460
the project is going to require a

194
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:57,360
report which is not limited to six pages a written presentation like PowerPoint of Beamer

195
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:04,830
and another presentation and because we have two dates in the fall with scheduling with

196
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:10,650
our presentations and videotaping them have not seen any of the videos yet by the

197
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:17,530
way of artists presentations yet because they have not been provided to me but have

198
00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:22,330
what we're going to do to avoid all that the next weekend we're going to

199
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:25,900
take maybe the last three or four lectures of the course and we're going to

200
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:30,950
have the presentations in class so you're going to be on this real video and

201
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:35,360
not issue because the videos are automatic okay so we don't have to worry about

202
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:38,020
story there's nothing available in May

203
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:45,800
sorry in June this building is closed in July is open for something else and

204
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:51,230
that we're gonna do it in class even if that takes lecture so be prepared

205
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:57,920
the that the project would be you wave before the end of the semester the

206
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:03,200
wave means you know three lectures of this before the end of the semester so

207
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:11,770
we're gonna have to move on the projects quite strong okay the services are very

208
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:18,130
preliminary so some of these topics we may cover them in lots of details but

209
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:25,900
some not we're going to discuss as I mentioned directive of the undirected graph this

210
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:28,700
should be of interest to everybody but

211
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:38,270
mainly you know in social and in social sciences natural language modeling things I thought

212
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:45,500
market models are basically essential for people to work in scientific applications we're going to

213
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,660
do it lots of 12 hours for data

214
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:55,250
simulation problems starting with basically a little relating everything that you may already know from

215
00:21:55,250 --> 00:22:02,270
other courses or not some of these topics we cover them and in the fall

216
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:07,130
so ideas for example of doing dynamical systems with particle methods now we will see

217
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:13,280
how to develop the same identical algorithms but with a graph theoretic approach so for

218
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,510
example you can think of doing

219
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:26,990
Kalman filtering and generalization always with no effort using algorithms on graphs nothing new but

220
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:31,890
the risk of slipping would grass you babel action to develop your own Oliver effect

221
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:38,300
you want to that this extension of standard methodologies  that have been around for thirty years

222
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:48,300
we're gonna spend maybe more than two lectures may be anything from five to ten

223
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:55,680
lectures to discuss inference in graphs and this concept of exacting first of course is

224
00:22:55,680 --> 00:23:00,840
you know it's not always possible so we are gonna start with this and then

225
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:06,690
we will so we will cover as part of exactly current idea so far the

226
00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:17,670
new propagation destruction pre algorithm elimination and the light will discuss about approximate inference using

227
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:28,440
generalizations of means you know means till the type of algorithms so this is an

228
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:34,170
important area and it actually an earlier that literally goes coefficient with graph theoretic algorithms

229
00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:36,600
so this will be an essential

230
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:42,750
part of the cost and if we have time I think maybe we spend two

231
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:47,280
three lectures to discussed on how do you learn the structure of a graph so

232
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:51,390
if somebody for hours view realizations for a few hundred of variables and you want

233
00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:57,050
to figure out how they are correlated how do we do this how do you

234
00:23:57,050 --> 00:24:02,160
come up with learning destruction of a graph and of course we've realized the this

235
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:09,140
is a very difficult open problem right so this is actually the fantastic area to

236
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:15,630
do a PhD not one piece P you can work for 100 feet this because

237
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:21,510
I don't believe this problem can be scaled many of the variables alright but it's

238
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:25,049
an important topic that is to be

239
00:24:25,049 --> 00:24:31,919
discussed so the lectures will give in the tape I think we think an hour

240
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:38,570
two of the lectures are available on Sakai when the website is up if not

241
00:24:38,570 --> 00:24:44,390
today tomorrow we will post these videotapes the on YouTube so will be that youtube

242
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:50,940
link where the lecture PDFs will be posted I hesitate actually have to think about

243
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:53,549
this if I want to post the lectures like

244
00:24:53,549 --> 00:24:57,840
we did in the fall so that you have them in front of you during

245
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:04,799
the lectures because I was observing certain individuals in this room but they are still

246
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:08,039
clear okay during my lectures basically doing nothing else but just looking on that computer

247
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:11,610
that's not the way to go I mean

248
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:14,820
why have you you know I mean they are looking at bookkeeping you can look

249
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:18,630
at form right since the business will be available this you need to come to

250
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:25,260
them I mean make me spill good of course if you come and I appreciate

251
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:36,750
but I think the idea is to be able to benefit even partially by listening

252
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:41,220
in person to these lectures okay but for sure the lectures will be positive if

253
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:49,980
not before immediately after you know you know in the afternoon of the same day

254
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:54,750
there will be a lots of references of papers and books and things I got

255
00:25:54,750 --> 00:26:00,539
that I will link to the lectures so consider those as very useful readings and

256
00:26:00,539 --> 00:26:07,500
also there will be a lot of chalkboard links that you can use this well

257
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:12,720
why would I forgot this because we're video tape I want to encourage questions but

258
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:20,500
I'm gonna have to repeat your questions otherwise nobody Houston anything okay so let me

259
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:26,420
stop there any questions about the structure of it all really there's no structure I

260
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:29,690
mean we do anything we want to we can change our mind tomorrow all right

261
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:32,480
we are interest money to learn and not

262
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:35,120
to go from A to B to C because I there's no such a thing

263
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:39,290
okay so and feel free to

264
00:26:39,290 --> 00:26:50,510
 take advantage drop any questions

265
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:58,070
of course the question I have to ask is how many of you will love

266
00:26:58,070 --> 00:27:05,690
stick with us on Thursday alright and I hope everybody alright bring the cousins -

267
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:11,650
okay we need all the support we can get

268
00:27:11,650 --> 00:27:18,520
I mean one of my students is teaching now at Purdue similar course as the

269
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:25,180
one without clearing in the fall more or less things are a little more basic

270
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:29,200
but she told me she has more than 60 they had to limit the cluster

271
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:33,760
talents was fixed it because they were students from every quarter interested but you know

272
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,920
here we're a small population so we

273
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:41,230
don't have the Nutri of 60 20 is actually a great number for example for

274
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:46,450
okay but you guys need to not to give up

275
00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:58,649
 when I give homework okay if you do give  up I'm sorry for you all right so no  questions

276
00:27:58,649 --> 00:28:09,180
any questions just to entertain the thing no but the way whichever I know who

277
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:13,680
have at least and students that will

278
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:26,580
be listening to be stopped from various places overseas okay I have been surprised the

279
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:32,119
receiving names of students from certain universities in China but they even do the homework

280
00:28:32,119 --> 00:28:37,980
and they submit me corrections to the homework okay so and corrections to the software

281
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:41,399
of the homework the case though

282
00:28:41,399 --> 00:28:52,019
and I have seen the impact some of this lectures have had on various health

283
00:28:52,019 --> 00:28:57,990
so it served quite rewarding okay so we're going to start with sort of some

284
00:28:57,990 --> 00:29:03,869
elementary introduction to control in a geographical borders discussing some terminology maybe one or two

285
00:29:03,869 --> 00:29:08,549
basic examples I am NOT gonna do any

286
00:29:08,549 --> 00:29:18,389
mathematics linear questions or anything like that but so if you see saying things that

287
00:29:18,389 --> 00:29:22,499
really require a lot of explanations keep in mind and when I come back to

288
00:29:22,499 --> 00:29:27,389
those topics and discuss them in detail as we go along right so this is

289
00:29:27,389 --> 00:29:33,210
just to give you a flavor of what a probabilistic graphical model is and what

290
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:41,430
the type of promise were interested by the way in addition to the video lectures

291
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:48,269
if from our course if you served with the constant form you say probabilistic graphical

292
00:29:48,269 --> 00:29:57,240
models you will find notes from many short court system here have heroes living divani

293
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:03,880
and Christmas of have a series of lectures on probabilistic graphical with videos and PDFs

294
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:09,960
but you know you can find online the Stanford courses and many other universities the

295
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:15,790
courses from Cornell etc so you can sort of if you have questions with a

296
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:22,120
certain topic if you turn you'll be able to find a lot of resources I

297
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:31,120
think the good thing is this area of machine learning it's an area of a

298
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:35,980
very open society that likes things out there to be open okay we don't hide

299
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:39,840
anything everybody can actually benefit and we like it that way

300
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:57,180
so we're really probabilistic graphical models just to model the relations between many random variables

301
00:30:57,180 --> 00:31:04,090
okay so now effectively would be a way to produce the joint probability of this

302
00:31:04,090 --> 00:31:07,900
body most so X here is a vector so the

303
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:15,810
probabilistic graphical models will give us sort of file an efficient way to model this

304
00:31:15,810 --> 00:31:21,540
distribution fire fact and something that we would need to be able to take advantage

305
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:26,260
when we work with grouches we're going to be able to account for the independent

306
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:31,740
relations between these variables by somehow

307
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:37,000
dropping some links from the graph as we wish it softly all right so I

308
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:45,400
have these two variables and they're not connected darkus an implication probabilistically speaking so the

309
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:52,560
idea here would be that the joint probability distribution when it is factorized according to

310
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:59,539
a graph or a graph is not right the model in the police relations you

311
00:31:59,539 --> 00:32:06,440
know inside this probability distribution if we do that we will be able to take

312
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:13,490
advantage of inference algorithms but still very nicely in graphs all right and in some

313
00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:18,950
of the solvent you used completely graph theoretic sort of argument and so they are

314
00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:25,370
very convenient now if somebody if

315
00:32:25,370 --> 00:32:30,950
you if I give you let's say 50 variables and you learn the joint probability

316
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:35,450
distribution and somehow you can factorize in some nice way the main interest will be

317
00:32:35,450 --> 00:32:40,039
to do inference which means if I knowledge say this stand variables what's the probability

318
00:32:40,039 --> 00:32:47,000
of very many variables all right and so we're going to have to do somehow

319
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:55,399
develop some algorithms that will allow us to compute marginal and conditional distributions out of

320
00:32:55,399 --> 00:32:57,799
this joint distribution the Adisa Teno the joint we should be able to do lots

321
00:32:57,799 --> 00:33:00,860
of things cheaply and in particular

322
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:06,019
that will be the case for graphs now when you have a joint distribution like

323
00:33:06,019 --> 00:33:09,169
that you will always have lots of

324
00:33:09,169 --> 00:33:17,029
unknown parameters to define the joint distribution so one of the tasks in probabilistic graphical

325
00:33:17,029 --> 00:33:21,500
model is to figure out what those parameters are given realizations of some random variables

326
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:25,370
okay so we would see examples

327
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:30,040
 of that

328
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:37,530
let's go so probably a feminist is basically for military plus graph theory okay we

329
00:33:37,530 --> 00:33:40,420
obviously we won't drop it because

330
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:46,420
we're graph speak we can visualize the independence relation between the many of the variables

331
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:49,840
and once we do that we

332
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:56,650
can motivate the lots of new algorithms I mean the posture can tell you when

333
00:33:56,650 --> 00:34:01,510
I was interested in solving some weird multi scale problems I've as long as visualizing

334
00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:03,400
of how this may look like

335
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:10,690
and everybody thought that was an idiot because somehow they couldn't see how probabilistic graphical

336
00:34:10,690 --> 00:34:15,550
model can be relevant but if it is here then you should be able to

337
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:25,240
put it in a computer program okay so visualizing the structure of a probability model

338
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:31,540
of thing is essential to get nice algorithms all right so we're going to develop

339
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:38,230
algorithms that they take advantage of this graph structure so we're going to be able

340
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:42,850
to do inference learning and all of these things affected in the graphs and the

341
00:34:42,850 --> 00:34:45,070
ideas for example of these masters

342
00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:56,770
 passing algorithms will be something  that you cannot do without a graph  theoretic approach

343
00:34:56,770 --> 00:35:03,580
so the benefit you get in sizing for the model you look actually graphically and

344
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:07,510
you can say lots of things as to how the

345
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:18,070
around the variables correlate to each other you can develop many new algorithms by playing

346
00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:26,230
with the structure of the graph and most of the inference we will do in

347
00:35:26,230 --> 00:35:32,530
this course can scale nicely simply because of this independence relations but implied by by

348
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:39,760
the gun action and actually I can tell

349
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:47,109
you that's quite all you don't need to know anything as a background all the

350
00:35:47,109 --> 00:35:51,130
calculations always in machine learning there are nothing else but applications of the solid product

351
00:35:51,130 --> 00:35:55,630
rules of probability and we will see this something on Thursday when we develop simple

352
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:58,540
things on graphs so realist you

353
00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:03,210
know the definitions of probabilities and what the stomach for the fruits are then you

354
00:36:03,210 --> 00:36:05,589
are ready best bid to do lots

355
00:36:05,589 --> 00:36:12,930
 of nice things

356
00:36:12,930 --> 00:36:19,640
but I told you that don't be scared I power lots of concepts because we

357
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:25,500
will develop all of this in separate lectures so I'm just throwing this as an

358
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:28,890
introduction so the dart is going to

359
00:36:28,890 --> 00:36:42,540
encode the whatever independence assumptions exist for my many random variables all right and basically

360
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:48,150
we'll be able to factorize the probability distribution on the graph or given a graph

361
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:49,730
we will know what type of

362
00:36:49,730 --> 00:36:59,430
factorization the graph complies for the probability distributions that we define the idea is that

363
00:36:59,430 --> 00:37:04,380
somehow this factorization of the joint probability distribution of the graph would be with local

364
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:07,290
functions that are defined on the

365
00:37:07,290 --> 00:37:18,329
notes of the graph so these local functions will be different things for directed graph

366
00:37:18,329 --> 00:37:24,180
which we also called the Bayesian networks and will be different for undirected graphs that

367
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:31,319
also we call them a mark of network okay but the idea is somehow a

368
00:37:31,319 --> 00:37:39,240
joint distribution between many of our variables can be written as a product of local

369
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:43,859
functions and this is great right but it's not so physically what you very did

370
00:37:43,859 --> 00:37:47,520
because if for example you think spatially many of the variables the variables here don't

371
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,680
depend on the volume is their right

372
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:54,599
correlation sort of local extent so somehow if you can arrange these things to the

373
00:37:54,599 --> 00:37:57,680
graph you have a similar nature

374
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:05,670
you will be able to do lots of work that is local and from these

375
00:38:05,670 --> 00:38:11,930
local functions you'll be able to say build this this joint distribution of the menu

376
00:38:11,930 --> 00:38:14,569
of the volumes by the way when

377
00:38:14,569 --> 00:38:21,500
I said some wearables of here and there this is in the special context or

378
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:27,440
in the time context but the goth can be a very abstract entity they have

379
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:34,099
nothing to do with space of time okay so don't you know again depending on

380
00:38:34,099 --> 00:38:41,990
the type of things you're interested you can envision different scenarios so Bayesian networks are

381
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:46,370
probabilistic graphical models that are defined on directed graphs and I'm gonna show you an

382
00:38:46,370 --> 00:38:55,490
example shortly and this Markov random pills this Markov networks are basically probabilistic graphical models

383
00:38:55,490 --> 00:39:03,890
for undirected graphs three so these are the main two types right and you can

384
00:39:03,890 --> 00:39:09,760
have some graphs that have some directed component some undirected components and also you can

385
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:12,950
pose this in sort of some

386
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:22,430
unified way using what's called photographs and we will discuss verse as well so actually

387
00:39:22,430 --> 00:39:27,530
you know three lectures there's no point of discussion one type or another we will

388
00:39:27,530 --> 00:39:33,470
unify development for all of this at the same time okay the nodes in the

389
00:39:33,470 --> 00:39:38,299
graph we represent are the variables and this is very important the lack of transition

390
00:39:38,299 --> 00:39:47,530
the graph will imply conditional independence assumptions in other ways if I have nodes representing

391
00:39:47,530 --> 00:39:52,549
random variables and I have to take ten variables and I connected smart evil with

392
00:39:52,549 --> 00:39:57,380
every other body world then there's no point of doing graphs because that problem complexity

393
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:59,089
will never allow you to go

394
00:39:59,089 --> 00:40:07,090
anyway it's somehow some edges are missing that implies to military somebody who don't depend

395
00:40:07,090 --> 00:40:08,590
on all the volume which the lots

396
00:40:08,590 --> 00:40:14,110
what we need to think about so the idea is we are interested in graphs

397
00:40:14,110 --> 00:40:17,740
that they are not fully connected right they are fully connected one of gaining anything

398
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:22,090
by learning this course right the idea

399
00:40:22,090 --> 00:40:28,020
is not everything depends on everything and we need to learn about part of the

400
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:31,660
structure problem that we discussed the

401
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:38,470
second part of the course but again the lack of threads is what represents conditional

402
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:43,360
independence assumptions and we spend two or three lectures to discuss that and I will

403
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:47,290
give you a number of formal projects to work on all right so something just

404
00:40:47,290 --> 00:40:55,660
let's go from right in there this is a directed graph I'm gonna give you

405
00:40:55,660 --> 00:41:03,910
the terminology in of the you know in follow up slide but just to get

406
00:41:03,910 --> 00:41:08,140
things going basically here you can use common sense interpretation for now you know so

407
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:11,110
all of this are other variables we have a b c d e are on

408
00:41:11,110 --> 00:41:16,240
two variables can be continuous or discrete doesn't really matter and the idea here of

409
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,980
the service means that C depends

410
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:25,900
today and B it depends on C and D right and so this implies this

411
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:31,600
direction of the arrow the causal relationship alright so big doesn't depend on me it

412
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:33,820
depends from D that's what I know from

413
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:42,700
here okay the rest you will need to derive from the factorization employed by this

414
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:44,890
directive model now this one direction

415
00:41:44,890 --> 00:41:51,220
graph there is no error okay so obviously if there's no arrows and you see

416
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:56,120
this connections obviously C is related to a a and B obviously she's related to

417
00:41:56,120 --> 00:42:04,520
you and to be envied so you serious tricks there was this interconnected sets of

418
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:08,180
notes so both imply really correlations

419
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:18,200
but there is no directional component so in essence the effect of EMV and BMC

420
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:26,450
has no direction okay so this is very different from what this chain is drawn

421
00:42:26,450 --> 00:42:33,010
okay now I'm not going to discuss what this is in detail right but this

422
00:42:33,010 --> 00:42:40,250
is sort of another type of graph that will allow us to sort of unify

423
00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:46,070
those two graphs okay and somehow to do that we need to introduce the sectional

424
00:42:46,070 --> 00:42:55,760
squared note but effectively explicitly spell out these local functions these local potentials but you

425
00:42:55,760 --> 00:43:01,010
have either in this undirected graphs or in the directed graphs so these are functional

426
00:43:01,010 --> 00:43:07,300
and that's why this is called a photograph okay so this are the random variables

427
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:17,200
and it's a constant okay and so we would be able to how to eventually

428
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:26,150
do inference in factor graphs and not way accounting for inference both directed and undirected

429
00:43:26,150 --> 00:43:31,280
model again you don't need to know anything any of this because we will spent

430
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:38,110
many lectures discussing each of this but I thought you should see this on lecture

431
00:43:38,110 --> 00:43:43,490
one so now is representative of variables edges dependencies and really what we're interested is

432
00:43:43,490 --> 00:43:45,800
in the lack of the edges

433
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:51,740
so the path but there is no edge between a and B that's very important

434
00:43:51,740 --> 00:43:57,450
if you try to connect a to B to D to Eve than don't expect

435
00:43:57,450 --> 00:44:07,080
to gain anything by doing graph theoretic approach okay so in if you have many

436
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:12,570
nodes so this is the trek high-dimensional this village h 100 the first objective when

437
00:44:12,570 --> 00:44:19,830
you work with graphs is to come up with the joint probability distribution and in

438
00:44:19,830 --> 00:44:22,740
particularly with the factorized form of

439
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:31,800
the joint probability distribution okay the fact is form that somehow can easily be visualized

440
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:42,630
in a graph accounting for whatever independence relations exist between these values now you can

441
00:44:42,630 --> 00:44:46,170
appreciate that if the variables dependent there is no independence relations right and each of

442
00:44:46,170 --> 00:44:51,930
these variables can take K values and let's say each of these columns is also

443
00:44:51,930 --> 00:44:55,770
discrete and can take K values how many

444
00:44:55,770 --> 00:45:03,240
values how much information you need to describe this probability distribution so you need K

445
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:11,940
values for each of them and you have via block how many variables Divinity's try

446
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:20,150
to describe this joint distribution with no independence relations at all

447
00:45:20,150 --> 00:45:23,950
take away the power

448
00:45:23,950 --> 00:45:28,809
the power B right so it least 10 forget about you won't be able to

449
00:45:28,809 --> 00:45:36,010
do anything okay so we will see on what we can benefit take and run

450
00:45:36,010 --> 00:45:43,450
up to this condition in the ventilation and drop now once somehow you can come

451
00:45:43,450 --> 00:45:47,710
up with the proper authorization of this then you can stop talking about the inference

452
00:45:47,710 --> 00:45:51,640
so for example if you let's say measure

453
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:55,720
the value of variable X 1 you have you know what the value is then

454
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:58,089
you can stay with the value of x 2 given X 1 where the rest

455
00:45:58,089 --> 00:45:59,829
of the variables maybe you want

456
00:45:59,829 --> 00:46:08,740
analyze them ok to get rid of them so obviously you appreciate that the sum

457
00:46:08,740 --> 00:46:11,260
and product rule will come candy to

458
00:46:11,260 --> 00:46:22,799
 actually manipulate this but also Bayes  rule would be essential when you have  evidence to be able to do inference

459
00:46:22,799 --> 00:46:35,109
applications really you know you just mentioned any anything right so in diaphragmatic this standard

460
00:46:35,109 --> 00:46:39,450
methods in in medical diagnosis actually

461
00:46:39,450 --> 00:46:49,980
almost every you know diagnosis now actually every time I am reading articles but visual

462
00:46:49,980 --> 00:46:57,069
to make the systems for diagnosing diseases would take from images etc they operate with

463
00:46:57,069 --> 00:47:03,430
much less chance for false alarms than the best doctor in the world right they're

464
00:47:03,430 --> 00:47:05,859
extremely accurate so now it's not like

465
00:47:05,859 --> 00:47:17,070
this is for mathematicians or computer scientists people in practice are actually using probably splatter

466
00:47:17,070 --> 00:47:24,570
model for prognosis all the loss of diseases computer vision speech recognition Google Translate I

467
00:47:24,570 --> 00:47:29,400
mean I use it you know when I go to China I always say something

468
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:34,080
and it translates and I always see what it translates to be sure it was

469
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:39,470
laced correctly because sometimes I say something and I read this like wow I'm gonna

470
00:47:39,470 --> 00:47:51,840
get in trouble and so it really works very well okay I mean I have

471
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:55,920
seen it even working when there are several people speaking simultaneously with action and it

472
00:47:55,920 --> 00:48:04,410
does miracles so it's really a director filtration of republished graphical models practically every topic

473
00:48:04,410 --> 00:48:11,940
of the algorithm machine learning can be posed on probabilistic graphical models for okay so

474
00:48:11,940 --> 00:48:15,000
we may I don't know if we have

475
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:20,790
time I covered it with ideas of blatant holy Moses model reduction in the fall

476
00:48:20,790 --> 00:48:24,420
so misspent electrocuted go back and

477
00:48:24,420 --> 00:48:30,480
address the ocean generalize them using graphical model so if you don't know anything about

478
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:35,430
what solvent is fine because when we post them in graphic we will post them

479
00:48:35,430 --> 00:48:39,150
as new problems and so you will see sort of a modern aspect of this

480
00:48:39,150 --> 00:48:43,200
algorithm and and I think you know

481
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:52,080
you like of more than a questions that without the means to visualizer the you

482
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:55,830
know error control codes and the way you

483
00:48:55,830 --> 00:49:03,480
know your computer you know restart and figure out what goes wrong right and and

484
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:07,350
became properly it's really based in in

485
00:49:07,350 --> 00:49:17,320
probabilistic graphical models if you take for most in engineering to take sort of you

486
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:19,540
know we talked about little to

487
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:26,770
undividable scanner there but actually the source of this adapter ones can be extremely effective

488
00:49:26,770 --> 00:49:35,800
for this knowledge they're not simply random variables but the interconnected complicated systems of differing

489
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:42,340
ology and mechanical model the thermal model etc and each of them has its own

490
00:49:42,340 --> 00:49:46,960
random by the Wilson within right but you have interconnected systems that speak to each

491
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:53,800
other and this is really sort of an important area for development because it points

492
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:59,800
a lot of tolerances because a lot of these systems are governed by models that

493
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:07,660
are very compassionate very expensive so so a lot of the methodologies for doing inference

494
00:50:07,660 --> 00:50:12,100
would not be able to sort of

495
00:50:12,100 --> 00:50:21,400
what directly you would have to do something there to simplify the representation of these

496
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:30,850
systems okay so let's you know go fast through the patient knowledge of the variables

497
00:50:30,850 --> 00:50:44,980
exist already said for publicity Lester the lock opens it basically will provide information on

498
00:50:44,980 --> 00:50:50,800
independence relations so graft has a number of nodes as a number of edges the

499
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:53,890
number of nodes from want to be the number of edges if we have a

500
00:50:53,890 --> 00:50:59,530
directed graph basically would be this

501
00:50:59,530 --> 00:51:05,980
pair s comma T where the else goes from the you know the arrow goes

502
00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:13,960
convexity okay now to really you know extend this the bottom directed and directed graphs

503
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:15,070
you have to use what's called an

504
00:51:15,070 --> 00:51:22,000
 adjacency matrix so if you define the  adjacency matrix

505
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:32,380
GF S&amp;P little notes equals one if the ads s comma T is in this

506
00:51:32,380 --> 00:51:38,500
set all right and this allows you to extend this to undirected graphs because if

507
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:43,150
you have G of s comma T equal 12 and simultaneous in G of T

508
00:51:43,150 --> 00:51:45,580
comma X equal to 1 right then

509
00:51:45,580 --> 00:51:51,099
this is an undirected graph there is no going from s to T and T

510
00:51:51,099 --> 00:51:56,590
2 s is the same okay so two examples and I threw a lot so

511
00:51:56,590 --> 00:51:59,230
far terminology here that's going to

512
00:51:59,230 --> 00:52:03,400
come in the following slides but it helps to see them several times so you

513
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:07,570
have note one two three four five I am

514
00:52:07,570 --> 00:52:13,720
going to call note one the road all right can you give me without rocks

515
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:19,150
or even reading the pull up slides just look on the graph what do you

516
00:52:19,150 --> 00:52:21,700
think the route will be I mean wouldn't be a good this mixture I mean

517
00:52:21,700 --> 00:52:25,390
you notice okay there is from you

518
00:52:25,390 --> 00:52:37,420
know so so in other ways why you know the route is of five and

519
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:44,579
it's one what will be a good definition

520
00:52:44,579 --> 00:52:53,160
right so so so I am repeating the answer here in this case one has

521
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:59,339
not lost coming to it okay and as we will see this implies following in

522
00:52:59,339 --> 00:53:06,989
definitions when I come up with one has no father okay and with a definition

523
00:53:06,989 --> 00:53:12,929
five them that is the nature of the graph five has no children okay so

524
00:53:12,929 --> 00:53:19,679
five has not simply sent one is

525
00:53:19,679 --> 00:53:29,670
the ornament of - all right and three you know here you know 40s -

526
00:53:29,670 --> 00:53:36,499
power is two and three okay etc and to achieve what else to come together

527
00:53:36,499 --> 00:53:39,599
is important and it phase again this is coming up later but I want you

528
00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:41,939
to see hundreds of times so we can

529
00:53:41,939 --> 00:53:53,969
communicate it says this directed a means it has no cycles of a cyclic graph

530
00:53:53,969 --> 00:54:01,890
all right you noticed has no better it has no cycles someone would say this

531
00:54:01,890 --> 00:54:06,689
is a cycle but actually because this is the electric graph you notice when I

532
00:54:06,689 --> 00:54:10,229
go the direction of the arrows here I cannot go from four to three so

533
00:54:10,229 --> 00:54:14,549
there are no cycles them okay

534
00:54:14,549 --> 00:54:18,390
alright so we discussed this and then it says the notes are number in topological

535
00:54:18,390 --> 00:54:21,870
order so what does not mean looks very

536
00:54:21,870 --> 00:54:27,029
sensual for the left graph what do we mean - political order just looking at

537
00:54:27,029 --> 00:54:28,829
this graph basically what will be sort

538
00:54:28,829 --> 00:54:50,930
 of your imagination share with us so the  numbering change in topological order so

539
00:54:50,930 --> 00:55:09,680
I mean complain I have always one two three four five

540
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:15,410
all right the tradition hearing bit right which since we define the route to be

541
00:55:15,410 --> 00:55:17,690
the note that has no parents all

542
00:55:17,690 --> 00:55:30,289
right so basically we have to start numbering from the root to the leaves basically

543
00:55:30,289 --> 00:55:36,339
okay and that's a topological order not to more complicated God you know this may

544
00:55:36,339 --> 00:55:45,200
not be a unique topological order all right but you start majestically you are not

545
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:53,539
going to assign to the chain to the children notice that they're in the order

546
00:55:53,539 --> 00:56:01,150
of numbering on the part right number the parents and the children that's the idea

547
00:56:01,150 --> 00:56:07,640
here okay so 2 &amp; 3 are the children so 1 will be there to

548
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:13,190
enter it will be there similarly these are the parents of course draw the numbering

549
00:56:13,190 --> 00:56:23,240
of topological order makes sense ok the same graph now if it was an undirected

550
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:28,579
graph okay these I'm pouring and lots of things because you know I want you

551
00:56:28,579 --> 00:56:34,730
to see those things hundreds of times and I'm details that are going to be

552
00:56:34,730 --> 00:56:39,910
discussed with lots of simple examples in coop lectures right but I want you to

553
00:56:39,910 --> 00:56:43,220
see these things now so in some sense I'm claiming that the gallop you see

554
00:56:43,220 --> 00:56:46,279
here it is very much the

555
00:56:46,279 --> 00:56:50,150
same as that job but they see there is something going on that's a little

556
00:56:50,150 --> 00:56:53,809
bit different what's the difference between the two block when you look at them okay

557
00:56:53,809 --> 00:56:56,000
there are no arrows but there is

558
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:07,710
something else that is different so what is definitely when you visually look at this

559
00:57:07,710 --> 00:57:13,430
two and three are connected and that's an essential step when you go from directly

560
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:21,780
drafts from directed so what are the two and three note what is common between

561
00:57:21,780 --> 00:57:30,530
two and three their parent just know the

562
00:57:30,530 --> 00:57:37,880
their points of what of power so when you went from a directed graph to

563
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:42,770
UM directive what you need to do is you need to be sure the parents

564
00:57:42,770 --> 00:57:51,050
are married because this is not today we don't allow Mary power okay so we

565
00:57:51,050 --> 00:57:56,900
marry them all right and this process methodical is called a modernization process okay people

566
00:57:56,900 --> 00:58:00,200
who think that I'm you know my

567
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:07,730
let you guess religious connotations but that's the terminology moralization okay so you basically have

568
00:58:07,730 --> 00:58:11,840
to marry the parents okay and actually immediately you can see when you marry the

569
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:16,430
parents you get moved in this graph okay so suddenly you went from no loops

570
00:58:16,430 --> 00:58:20,510
to two loops right and and obvious

571
00:58:20,510 --> 00:58:27,020
implications in the way we're going to treat this process now in the graphs once

572
00:58:27,020 --> 00:58:29,360
you moralize you marry the parts

573
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:34,820
two and three we define what this whole page and if particularly of interest here

574
00:58:34,820 --> 00:58:38,140
is what is called maximal cliques

575
00:58:38,140 --> 00:58:48,880
okay so click is a set of interconnected no okay so for example if you

576
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:54,530
this is one two or three is a clique right because one is connected to

577
00:58:54,530 --> 00:58:56,900
one squared - 3 + 2 is correct - 3 all the nodes are connected

578
00:58:56,900 --> 00:59:01,520
now you say is 1 2 3 and

579
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:09,750
privately why not one employee without connected right 2 + 5 3 &amp; 5 are

580
00:59:09,750 --> 00:59:15,870
not correct ok so 1 2 &amp; 3 2

581
00:59:15,870 --> 00:59:21,170
3 &amp; 4 &amp; 3 &amp; 5 of what they call we called maxima please

582
00:59:21,170 --> 00:59:25,290
and I can tell you and this will come in

583
00:59:25,290 --> 00:59:31,080
four five lectures I don't know the idea of identifying this parchment which will be

584
00:59:31,080 --> 00:59:34,590
but when we take a joint probability

585
00:59:34,590 --> 00:59:40,650
distribution of this paragraph around the variables we're going to be able to write the

586
00:59:40,650 --> 00:59:45,750
joint distribution as the product of potentials is with this potential behind on our table

587
00:59:45,750 --> 00:59:51,630
please so the local potentials what its potential would be on automatically and that would

588
00:59:51,630 --> 00:59:56,850
be actually an amazing theorem which we are going to prove right but somehow if

589
00:59:56,850 --> 01:00:01,380
you have a graph like that and a probability distribution defined on this graph then

590
01:00:01,380 --> 01:00:07,220
that you can decompose it on potentials defined over this box conflicts okay again think

591
01:00:07,220 --> 01:00:12,000
of this as start from the

592
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:20,400
air ideas because we will discuss those as we go in underneath a course okay

593
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:28,620
so let's see the parents of a node all right you remember the conduit defining

594
01:00:28,620 --> 01:00:30,150
what was the name of G this is the

595
01:00:30,150 --> 01:00:36,150
adjacency matrix so the parent of a node s are all the node equal G

596
01:00:36,150 --> 01:00:38,550
of T comma s is equal to R so for example the parent of non-stick

597
01:00:38,550 --> 01:00:43,370
are two and five okay and

598
01:00:43,370 --> 01:00:51,300
you can denote this as five six equal to point 5 or X 5 6

599
01:00:51,300 --> 01:00:59,540
you know different notations I think this is participating  both notations are the ones used by

600
01:00:59,540 --> 01:01:10,190
the Michael Jordan stuff the two dates of no vest are basically the notes leaf

601
01:01:10,190 --> 01:01:14,900
touch of Geo Testament equal to one the

602
01:01:14,900 --> 01:01:21,500
climbing of an old alright is best and the pairing suppressed and so I actually

603
01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:24,860
what I was looking is like you know why

604
01:01:24,860 --> 01:01:29,150
they don't like the children all right but somehow that's why maybe I never use

605
01:01:29,150 --> 01:01:33,230
the terminology commonly but until we

606
01:01:33,230 --> 01:01:37,130
find that this is not right in definition this is what it is there so

607
01:01:37,130 --> 01:01:40,300
the family is asked and the parts of us

608
01:01:40,300 --> 01:01:45,260
we already discussed route least the knows no parents to leave the know dot children

609
01:01:45,260 --> 01:01:51,920
the ancestors of an LP are all

610
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:58,400
the notes s where there is a path from s to T and equal to

611
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:06,110
directed graph this path has to be a directed path if some directed basically any

612
01:02:06,110 --> 01:02:08,780
path from s to T will do it and the descendants of an arrest are

613
01:02:08,780 --> 01:02:13,910
all the nodes right but you

614
01:02:13,910 --> 01:02:20,060
can find the trail from s to T and again in the ref graphs this

615
01:02:20,060 --> 01:02:29,020
trail we have to follow the arrow so these are the ancestors and goes to

616
01:02:29,020 --> 01:02:34,820
the central the [Applause] neighborhoods and it doesn't matter what I will graph we have

617
01:02:34,820 --> 01:02:44,780
the immediately corrected note so the neighbors of s all the taste provided 0% equal

618
01:02:44,780 --> 01:02:50,600
to one of G of T of s equal to one okay so in defining

619
01:02:50,600 --> 01:03:00,170
the neighbors given even if it's a directed graph the orientation it's not important so

620
01:03:00,170 --> 01:03:03,079
the degree of a node is the number of neighbors and in particular you would

621
01:03:03,079 --> 01:03:07,849
see this and lots of Muslim leavening books the in-and-out degrees basically count the number

622
01:03:07,849 --> 01:03:13,250
of parents and the number of children so when they say the in degrees the

623
01:03:13,250 --> 01:03:19,789
number of parents they are degrees the number of children and this is sort of

624
01:03:19,789 --> 01:03:28,279
an important concept because when we write the joint probability distribution we would see the

625
01:03:28,279 --> 01:03:34,640
factorization will still basically with this in degrees with a number of parents retaining I

626
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:42,200
may actually show you in the slide shortly we already discuss the concept of a

627
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:46,339
directed cycle alright so in this

628
01:03:46,339 --> 01:03:51,640
diagram here there is no directed cycle but you notice from this this one okay

629
01:03:51,640 --> 01:03:55,460
on this there is no directed cycle all

630
01:03:55,460 --> 01:04:04,900
right so a directed Pacific Loft is a directed graph with non directed cycles okay

631
01:04:04,900 --> 01:04:06,790
and most of the graphs we are going to

632
01:04:06,790 --> 01:04:12,400
use will be direct the strictly graphs but you know when we generalized we will

633
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:19,540
be able to go away without okay this

634
01:04:19,540 --> 01:04:28,030
principle the three and the direct entry is very essential because algorithms on three are

635
01:04:28,030 --> 01:04:33,250
they just implement all right and you know we wish that every graph was a

636
01:04:33,250 --> 01:04:36,610
three because if it's a three we

637
01:04:36,610 --> 01:04:45,360
can do inference in second so this total would be an ideal situation so an

638
01:04:45,360 --> 01:04:48,610
undirected three is an undirected graph

639
01:04:48,610 --> 01:04:55,570
with no cycles all right and for an undirected tree there is a single path

640
01:04:55,570 --> 01:04:59,760
between any pair of nodes okay

641
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:04,330
and I'm starting with this right because I would be to be able to define

642
01:05:04,330 --> 01:05:09,490
this concept of 23 for directed graphs and with an internal directory strain on directory

643
01:05:09,490 --> 01:05:12,640
is an undirected graph with no

644
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:24,280
cycles okay so for example did we have an undirected three stomach work without cycles

645
01:05:24,280 --> 01:05:26,200
here so this is not good then we

646
01:05:26,200 --> 01:05:31,450
have reading picture anyway specimen and don't see it and maybe we'll want to come

647
01:05:31,450 --> 01:05:36,730
alright for our way so you know

648
01:05:36,730 --> 01:05:41,950
directory has no cycles so there is a single path from any pair of nodes

649
01:05:41,950 --> 01:05:50,860
now a directed three is a directed three is a directed a strictly graph in

650
01:05:50,860 --> 01:05:59,170
which every node has at most one Parliament can we tell me why do we

651
01:05:59,170 --> 01:06:03,589
want one parent and how is that going to be connected with the modernization process

652
01:06:03,589 --> 01:06:06,769
that I mentioned for it says the director 3 is a dog in which every

653
01:06:06,769 --> 01:06:11,299
notice at most one part you

654
01:06:11,299 --> 01:06:20,599
never are certified for there this equivalency of a directive three-wheeler on directly after we

655
01:06:20,599 --> 01:06:27,410
did some operations which we called moralization success a directory is a dog in which

656
01:06:27,410 --> 01:06:34,700
every notice of Western palate so why the authorities think has one polished because it

657
01:06:34,700 --> 01:06:40,370
has two polished then what is going to happen when we transform it to know

658
01:06:40,370 --> 01:06:42,049
directly graph we will marry those

659
01:06:42,049 --> 01:06:52,609
parents and as a result we will get the site right so in directed three

660
01:06:52,609 --> 01:07:01,279
needs to care everyone has at most one part okay now so this will be

661
01:07:01,279 --> 01:07:08,209
ideal situations right to have enough directly or the direction three now if we have

662
01:07:08,209 --> 01:07:13,789
directed a strictly graphical just one on one parent right and we mobilize it effectively

663
01:07:13,789 --> 01:07:18,829
we will get you know we get

664
01:07:18,829 --> 01:07:27,499
cycles but if the undirected glass that we get is a tree all right then

665
01:07:27,499 --> 01:07:37,940
we can call this the recognizer for the pony  tree okay so let's see some examples  here

666
01:07:37,940 --> 01:07:42,050
can you tell me which one this graphs is a train which to one is

667
01:07:42,050 --> 01:07:50,920
a poly-tree or you know what is this car is this Satori they're coming to

668
01:07:50,920 --> 01:07:56,300
our definition right over there ft3 is very very noxious of most one pilot does

669
01:07:56,300 --> 01:08:02,210
this loop to be like a tree right so this actually transform in eastern undirected

670
01:08:02,210 --> 01:08:09,080
graph right there will be no novelization of step so the interconnect is not in

671
01:08:09,080 --> 01:08:12,380
that because you know this just this is the part that has happened father so

672
01:08:12,380 --> 01:08:15,620
you have every not just one part so

673
01:08:15,620 --> 01:08:19,370
there would be a single platform everybody know to any other node so this 2

674
01:08:19,370 --> 01:08:24,620
3 now why is this a 33 it looks like

675
01:08:24,620 --> 01:08:32,599
in a simple tree but actually it's a 43 the reason is what this night

676
01:08:32,599 --> 01:08:38,930
has how many product is 2 so when you merge them all right and you

677
01:08:38,930 --> 01:08:40,640
make this an undirected graph yes there is a single path from every node to

678
01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:42,470
any other node but there is a

679
01:08:42,470 --> 01:08:53,150
cycle there ok now obviously you know the algorithms will get a bit more complicated

680
01:08:53,150 --> 01:08:57,650
when you have a poly-tree but actually when you transform this to the third form

681
01:08:57,650 --> 01:09:00,770
of graph that I call it

682
01:09:00,770 --> 01:09:06,110
the pasta graph but you will see that you can treat the 23 basically a

683
01:09:06,110 --> 01:09:10,910
penny tree will become actually there at 3 okay and then you can apply the

684
01:09:10,910 --> 01:09:18,050
standard algorithm so we've seen this cost okay but you need to change the grade

685
01:09:18,050 --> 01:09:23,660
the the graph is the quad so now think this would be a fantastic for

686
01:09:23,660 --> 01:09:30,170
graphs look like that this will also be fantastic so it is more complicated but

687
01:09:30,170 --> 01:09:36,530
somehow we will be able to do you know develop algorithms that they have the

688
01:09:36,530 --> 01:09:41,649
same complex this it will work okay so this is basically the same thing we

689
01:09:41,649 --> 01:09:45,789
just discussed and the same thing

690
01:09:45,789 --> 01:09:52,209
here so we talked about cliques and maximal cliques so there is this constant of

691
01:09:52,209 --> 01:09:53,979
a clique is only defined for

692
01:09:53,979 --> 01:10:05,919
undirected graphs and again a much more clique is the the highest number of interconnected

693
01:10:05,919 --> 01:10:10,510
nodes and highest number means you cannot go and consider adding another no to the

694
01:10:10,510 --> 01:10:22,240
clique without violating the property okay so this would be an essential development sir charies

695
01:10:22,240 --> 01:10:29,939
a directed graph when you mobilize this to make it an undirected graph that looks

696
01:10:29,939 --> 01:10:34,450
like up okay so what what parents if I married here 2 &amp; 3 right

697
01:10:34,450 --> 01:10:38,229
5 this pillow and that C 7 has how

698
01:10:38,229 --> 01:10:47,470
many parents has 3 votes right how's the post will have three parts well there's

699
01:10:47,470 --> 01:10:51,580
some religion is allowed okay so we

700
01:10:51,580 --> 01:11:02,080
marry for a 5 pollen sticks okay so alright and again you know I'm trying

701
01:11:02,080 --> 01:11:06,399
this just to treat from now but yeah

702
01:11:06,399 --> 01:11:12,129
we're going to discuss this in details right so you know just remember what this

703
01:11:12,129 --> 01:11:16,810
process of organization means and somehow we haven't proved the district we will into this

704
01:11:16,810 --> 01:11:22,419
and whatever you know how many I said well equivalent means right so we will

705
01:11:22,419 --> 01:11:32,840
see when we discussed about optimization of the joint probability distribution - gross alright so

706
01:11:32,840 --> 01:11:38,600
highways the goal right so let me give you without any prints or anything like

707
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:43,280
that okay because we will come back to this I would join probably distribution of

708
01:11:43,280 --> 01:11:49,250
this seven variables is they compose based on the graph that you see okay so

709
01:11:49,250 --> 01:11:54,310
the notation next one to seven means this is the joint probability electronic Stewart seven

710
01:11:54,310 --> 01:12:00,560
and now if we have a graph right

711
01:12:00,560 --> 01:12:08,870
and somebody gives you the the you know P effects want to at seven the

712
01:12:08,870 --> 01:12:11,720
theory tells you what's the what is going to be the right hand side I

713
01:12:11,720 --> 01:12:14,690
mean without looking at this right so

714
01:12:14,690 --> 01:12:18,200
you don't look at this what is to improve ability relates to join of variables

715
01:12:18,200 --> 01:12:20,780
of the two effects one touch

716
01:12:20,780 --> 01:12:29,470
seven varieties will be north x one times what the effect is even worth after

717
01:12:29,470 --> 01:12:35,180
and and p53 given x1 x2 etc now if

718
01:12:35,180 --> 01:12:38,990
you notice general claiming well it's actually much simpler that states P of x1 times

719
01:12:38,990 --> 01:12:42,380
P of x2 given X 1 P of X 3

720
01:12:42,380 --> 01:12:47,840
given X 1 P notice that in the worst case there are like three arguments

721
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:55,100
in the condition can look at the graph to look at this equation and tells

722
01:12:55,100 --> 01:12:59,990
me again I'm feeling nothing like I'm spying is there and can you look at

723
01:12:59,990 --> 01:13:16,649
this and somehow imagine what the God tells you  but somehow it's not first this equation  without integration

724
01:13:16,649 --> 01:13:23,720
well it's so basically if service Bathurst is so every which is a copter and

725
01:13:23,720 --> 01:13:25,950
in this case this parcel is a

726
01:13:25,950 --> 01:13:35,340
probability is a conditional probability distribution of the the variable in that note conditioned on

727
01:13:35,340 --> 01:13:37,439
its parent so here I have the probability of X 1 conditioned on the parents

728
01:13:37,439 --> 01:13:40,140
of X 1 what parents each

729
01:13:40,140 --> 01:13:50,520
one has no extradition apparent which is one extreme condition the parents which is one

730
01:13:50,520 --> 01:13:54,870
except 12 condition the parents which is 2 X tribe on 2 &amp; 3 that's

731
01:13:54,870 --> 01:14:05,939
fixed on 5 &amp; 3 &amp; at 7 on 4 5 &amp; 6 now the

732
01:14:05,939 --> 01:14:11,459
reason that this looks way simpler run the what the product will repel you write

733
01:14:11,459 --> 01:14:14,340
the people first time we have actually said one condition of x1 x2 x3 x4

734
01:14:14,340 --> 01:14:17,939
x5 x6 the fact that you don't

735
01:14:17,939 --> 01:14:22,740
have X 1 X 2 X 3 X 2 X 3 means that X 7

736
01:14:22,740 --> 01:14:26,910
is independent of the variables X 1 X 2

737
01:14:26,910 --> 01:14:34,530
X 3 given the variables X 4 X 5 vs. now I have no proof

738
01:14:34,530 --> 01:14:36,149
anything I'm just telling what the answers would be when we do the proof okay

739
01:14:36,149 --> 01:14:40,260
so somehow look at the graph

740
01:14:40,260 --> 01:14:46,560
you should be able to immediately just from the graph presented the composition that you

741
01:14:46,560 --> 01:14:51,330
know is the correct decomposition so here I have to do calculations by chant and

742
01:14:51,330 --> 01:14:58,580
try for 10 hours and addition so that you know  immediately with that perform this and

743
01:14:58,580 --> 01:15:12,600
this you know you know if we had seven variables and each variable takes K

744
01:15:12,600 --> 01:15:17,010
values the with no independence relations right I'm gonna need five to the seventh to

745
01:15:17,010 --> 01:15:25,410
describe the joint probability distribution on the left hand side but you noticed requiring sort

746
01:15:25,410 --> 01:15:29,130
of probability tables Hotel smaller size so let's say P X 1 you need K

747
01:15:29,130 --> 01:15:32,910
values be affected to give an

748
01:15:32,910 --> 01:15:37,290
extra on K square I'm not a counting here for the harmonization of this probabilities

749
01:15:37,290 --> 01:15:40,590
make like is e this is K 3

750
01:15:40,590 --> 01:15:46,620
and this is K 4 so basically if we have independence relations that you see

751
01:15:46,620 --> 01:15:51,300
in the graph we haven't really proved anything again I emphasized this is lecture wrong

752
01:15:51,300 --> 01:15:54,600
to just scare you so you

753
01:15:54,600 --> 01:16:03,540
can not come on closely but this it's K to the fourth versus if you

754
01:16:03,540 --> 01:16:08,400
have no independence at all which would be K to the sub okay so independence

755
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:13,680
relations and independence relations in the graph G no imply from the talk but let's

756
01:16:13,680 --> 01:16:19,920
say no two and three are not linked right two and seven are not linked

757
01:16:19,920 --> 01:16:25,080
politics on of being one is definitely so this lot of edges between knowledge is

758
01:16:25,080 --> 01:16:29,220
what leads to this factorization and that's very nice because you can read it on

759
01:16:29,220 --> 01:16:39,940
the clock because each of these  distributions is a factor of the  probability of hits note from this  knowledge part

760
01:16:39,940 --> 01:16:45,020
145 that's when we supposed to finish all right so I'm going to continue on

761
01:16:45,020 --> 01:16:48,530
this lecture with a few more examples

762
01:16:48,530 --> 01:16:55,670
and then we will take things slowly and discuss all the details on directed graphs

763
01:16:55,670 --> 01:16:59,030
and we will move from there

764
01:16:59,030 --> 01:17:06,920
so the website I will try to put the neck strap at the latest way

765
01:17:06,920 --> 01:17:13,220
tomorrow we've had the latest by tomorrow okay and and actually I'm going to tend

766
01:17:13,220 --> 01:17:19,340
to those register and when I sent a copy of at least paper Bakula chapter

767
01:17:19,340 --> 01:17:25,670
from Jordans butcher you can start reading  them all right so I'll see you on  Thursday
