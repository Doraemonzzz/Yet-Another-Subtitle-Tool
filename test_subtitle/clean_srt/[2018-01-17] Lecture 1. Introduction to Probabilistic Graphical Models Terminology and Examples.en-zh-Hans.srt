communicate it says this directed a means it has no cycles of a cyclic graph
表示它没有循环图的周期

1045
00:53:53,969 --> 00:53:53,979
all right you noticed has no better it has no cycles someone would say this

1046
00:53:53,979 --> 00:54:01,890
all right you noticed has no better it has no cycles someone would say this
你注意到没有更好，没有周期有人会说这是周期

1047
00:54:01,890 --> 00:54:01,900
is a cycle but actually because this is the electric graph you notice when I
你注意到没有更好，没有周期有人会说这是周期

1048
00:54:01,900 --> 00:54:06,689
is a cycle but actually because this is the electric graph you notice when I
但这实际上是因为这是您在我进去时注意到的电图

1049
00:54:06,689 --> 00:54:06,699
go the direction of the arrows here I cannot go from four to three so
但这实际上是因为这是您在我进去时注意到的电图

1050
00:54:06,699 --> 00:54:10,229
go the direction of the arrows here I cannot go from four to three so

1051
00:54:10,229 --> 00:54:10,239
there are no cycles them okay
箭头的方向在这里我不能从四个变到三个

1052
00:54:10,239 --> 00:54:14,549
there are no cycles them okay
所以没有周期，他们还好吧，所以我们讨论了这个，然后

1053
00:54:14,549 --> 00:54:16,869
alright so we discussed this and then it says the notes are number in topological
所以没有周期，他们还好吧，所以我们讨论了这个，然后

1054
00:54:16,869 --> 00:54:18,390
alright so we discussed this and then it says the notes are number in topological
说音符是按拓扑顺序编号的，所以这并不意味着看起来非常

1055
00:54:18,390 --> 00:54:21,870
order so what does not mean looks very
说音符是按拓扑顺序编号的，所以这并不意味着看起来非常

1056
00:54:21,870 --> 00:54:21,880
sensual for the left graph what do we mean - political order just looking at

sensual for the left graph what do we mean - political order just looking at
左图是感性的，我们的意思是什么-政治秩序只是看

1058
00:54:27,029 --> 00:54:27,039
this graph basically what will be sort
左图是感性的，我们的意思是什么-政治秩序只是看

1059
00:54:27,039 --> 00:54:28,829
this graph basically what will be sort
该图基本上将是您的想象力与我们分享的内容，因此

1060
00:54:28,829 --> 00:54:34,239
 of your imagination share with us so the  numbering change in topological order so
该图基本上将是您的想象力与我们分享的内容，因此

1061
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:38,849
 of your imagination share with us so the  numbering change in topological order so
编号按拓扑顺序更改，因此

1062
00:54:38,849 --> 00:54:50,930
 of your imagination share with us so the  numbering change in topological order so
我的意思是抱怨我总是一二三四五

1063
00:54:50,930 --> 00:54:57,770
I mean complain I have always one two three four five
我的意思是抱怨我总是一二三四五

1064
00:54:57,770 --> 00:55:09,680
I mean complain I have always one two three four five
好的，传统的听力有点好，因为我们定义了通往

1065
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:15,410
all right the tradition hearing bit right which since we define the route to be
好的，传统的听力有点好，因为我们定义了通往

1066
00:55:15,410 --> 00:55:15,420
the note that has no parents all
好的，传统的听力有点好，因为我们定义了通往

1067
00:55:15,420 --> 00:55:17,690
the note that has no parents all
是没有父母没事的音符，所以基本上我们必须开始

1068
00:55:17,690 --> 00:55:22,380
right so basically we have to start numbering from the root to the leaves basically
是没有父母没事的音符，所以基本上我们必须开始

1069
00:55:22,380 --> 00:55:30,289
right so basically we have to start numbering from the root to the leaves basically
从根到叶的编号基本上没问题，这是一种拓扑

1070
00:55:30,289 --> 00:55:30,299
okay and that's a topological order not to more complicated God you know this may
从根到叶的编号基本上没问题，这是一种拓扑

1071
00:55:30,299 --> 00:55:36,339
okay and that's a topological order not to more complicated God you know this may
为了不更复杂的上帝，你知道这可能不是唯一的

1072
00:55:36,339 --> 00:55:36,349
not be a unique topological order all right but you start majestically you are not
为了不更复杂的上帝，你知道这可能不是唯一的

1073
00:55:36,349 --> 00:55:45,200
not be a unique topological order all right but you start majestically you are not
拓扑顺序还可以，但是您雄伟地开始了，您不会

1074
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:45,210
going to assign to the chain to the children notice that they're in the order
拓扑顺序还可以，但是您雄伟地开始了，您不会

00:55:45,210 --> 00:55:53,539
going to assign to the chain to the children notice that they're in the order
分配给孩子链注意，他们按照以下顺序

1076
00:55:53,539 --> 00:55:53,549
of numbering on the part right number the parents and the children that's the idea
分配给孩子链注意，他们按照以下顺序

1077
00:55:53,549 --> 00:56:00,420
of numbering on the part right number the parents and the children that's the idea
正确编号的部分就是给父母和孩子编号

1078
00:56:00,420 --> 00:56:01,150
of numbering on the part right number the parents and the children that's the idea
好吧，所以2＆3是孩子，所以1会

1079
00:56:01,150 --> 00:56:05,970
here okay so 2 &amp; 3 are the children so 1 will be there to
好吧，所以2＆3是孩子，所以1会

1080
00:56:05,970 --> 00:56:07,640
here okay so 2 &amp; 3 are the children so 1 will be there to
在那里进入它将类似地有这些是的父母

1081
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:10,020
enter it will be there similarly these are the parents of course draw the numbering
在那里进入它将类似地有这些是的父母

1082
00:56:10,020 --> 00:56:13,190
enter it will be there similarly these are the parents of course draw the numbering
当然，绘制拓扑顺序编号现在可以使同一张图有意义

1083
00:56:13,190 --> 00:56:16,770
of topological order makes sense ok the same graph now if it was an undirected
当然，绘制拓扑顺序编号现在可以使同一张图有意义

和那个工作一样，但是他们看到有些事情正在发生

1096
00:56:50,150 --> 00:56:50,160
bit different what's the difference between the two block when you look at them okay
和那个工作一样，但是他们看到有些事情正在发生

01:15:12,600 --> 01:15:14,290
values the with no independence relations right I'm gonna need five to the seventh to

手边，但您注意到需要排序几率表

1458
01:15:25,410 --> 01:15:25,420
of probability tables Hotel smaller size so let's say P X 1 you need K

概率使得像e是K 3并且这是K 4所以基本上如果我们有

1465
01:15:40,590 --> 01:15:44,620
and this is K 4 so basically if we have independence relations that you see

1469
01:15:51,300 --> 01:15:54,600
to just scare you so you
我再强调一遍，这是一次错误的演讲，只是吓you了你，所以你

不能接近，但这是K到第四位，如果没有

1472
01:16:03,540 --> 01:16:03,550
have no independence at all which would be K to the sub okay so independence

1473
01:16:03,550 --> 01:16:08,400
have no independence at all which would be K to the sub okay so independence
完全是独立的，那么就好了，所以独立关系

1474
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:08,410
relations and independence relations in the graph G no imply from the talk but let's
